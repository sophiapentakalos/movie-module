    "title": "Hamilton Streaming: 6 Quick Things We Know About Hamilton On Disney+",
    "content": "Disney fans and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/hamilton\"><em>Hamilton</em></a> lovers received an early present when Lin Manuel-Miranda announced that Disney+ plans to stream the movie 15 months earlier than expected, and this summer. The <em>Hamilton</em> movie won\u2019t be an on-screen adaptation, like Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s other hit <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2480622/in-the-heights\">musical <em>In The Heights</em></a><em>.</em> Instead it will be a recording of the Broadway stage production. It\u2019s a great time to be a theater geek. <em>Hamilton</em> is the global smash hit that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1533000/meet-lin-manuel-miranda-9-fascinating-things-to-know-about-the-hamilton-mastermind\">stars Lin-Manuel Miranda</a> as founding father Alexander Hamilton. It tells the life and history of Hamilton, while exploring layers of this complex individual--all unfolding through hip hop songs. Since it\u2019s 2015 release, Hamilton has <a href=\"https://www.broadwayworld.com/grossescumulative.cfm\">grossed over $600 million</a> to date, and added <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489619/lin-manuel-mirandas-hamilton-movie-reportedly-cost-disney-a-fortune-to-acquire\">another $75 million</a> when Disney won the bidding war to acquire the rights to stream and distribute the <em>Hamilton</em> movie. <em>Hamilton</em> has been a massive success since its initial run, winning 11 Tony Awards, a Grammy, and a 2016 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. With such an impressive resume, it\u2019s no wonder Disney couldn\u2019t wait to bring the musical to their streaming service. Before <em>Hamilton</em> takes over my weekend--since I\u2019m definitely going to watch it a few dozen times once it hits Disney+--here are a few quick facts to know about the upcoming <em>Hamilton</em> movie production. <em>Hamilton</em> will stream on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496052/surprise-lin-manuel-mirandas-hamilton-movie-is-dropping-early-and-heading-directly-to-homes\">Disney+ on July 3, 2020</a>, just in time for the July 4th weekend. News that the Broadway production came as a surprise to many fans, considering we originally thought we'd have to wait until late 2021 to see it. Which brings us to our next point... In February, Disney won the bidding wars for the rights to release <em>Hamilton</em> in theaters. It was scheduled <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489534/the-hamilton-movie-is-happening-but-not-how-youd-think\">for an October 15, 2021</a> release in the United States and Canada. It was then scheduled to premiere on Disney+, but no date was ever confirmed for the original Disney+ release. Some speculated that it might be released in early 2022 on the house of mouse streaming service. <em>Hamilton</em> was filmed in June 2016, two weeks prior to the original cast leaving their respective roles. It was filmed over the course of three performances. <em>Hamilton</em> was shot on Broadway at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York City. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/02/disney-paid-75-million-hamilton-movie-deal-lin-manuel-miranda-largest-film-acquisition-ever-1202849929/\">According to Deadline,</a> the <em>Hamilton</em> film is supposed to have a 2 hours and 40 minutes runtime. This information came out when the news of Disney's acquisition of the production was originally announced. It seems likely this is an accurate runtime, considering the Broadway production <a href=\"https://www.broadway.com/shows/hamilton-broadway/\">typically runs</a> around two hours and fifty-five minutes, including intermission. <a href=\"https://www.onstageblog.com/editorials/2020/2/5/hamilton-is-not-coming-to-movie-theaters-with-the-original-broadway-cast\">Most of the original <em>Hamilton</em> cast</a> will appear in the taped production. The list includes:<br/> Lin-Manuel Miranda as Alexander Hamilton<br/> Daveed Diggs (<em>The</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1587990/snowpiercer-may-be-the-next-movie-to-become-a-tv-series\"><em>Snowpiercer</em> series)</a> as Marquis de Lafayette/Thomas Jefferson<br/> Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry as Angelica Schuyler<br/> Leslie Odom, Jr. as Aaron Burr<br/> Christopher Jackson as George Washington<br/> Jonathan Groff (<em>Mindhunter</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1651780/frozen-2\">and <em>Frozen II)</em></a> as King George<br/> Phillipa Soo as Eliza Hamilton<br/> Jasmine Cephas Jones as Peggy Schuyler/Maria Reynolds<br/> Okieriete Onaodowan as Hercules Mulligan/James Madison<br/> Anthony Ramos as John Laurens/Philip Hamilton The cast also includes performances by Carleigh Bettiol, Ariana DeBose, Hope Easterbrook, Sydney James Harcourt, Sasha Hutchings, Thayne Jasperson, Elizabeth Judd, Jon Rua, Austin Smith, Seth Stewart and Ephraim Sykes. <em>Hamilton</em>\u2019s taped production will be a little different from many <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496288/les-miserables-and-other-broadway-productions-and-specials-to-watch-while-you-wait-for-hamilton\">movie theatrical performances</a>. It was directed by Tommy Kail, who also directed the original production, and it may include some shots of the audience. When news of the theatrical released was announced, Tommy Kail had this to say about his filmed production: In 2019, <em>Hamilton</em> star Leslie Odom Jr also shared some of the details about the upcoming film when he appeared on Andy Cohen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.playbill.com/article/leslie-odom-jr-says-filmed-stage-version-of-hamilton-will-be-releasedeventually\"><em>Watch What Happens Live</em></a>. He said that he hadn\u2019t seen it yet, but they got in really \u201ctight and close\u201d with filming the production. He also said that from those who saw it, they said that it was really beautiful and well done. There are a lot of things that we do know about the staged version of <em>Hamilton,</em> but there are still <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496058/hamilton-fans-already-have-questions-about-the-movie-going-to-disney\">a few questions</a> that we have about the upcoming film. The stage version of <em>Hamilton</em> included some language that might not be family friendly. We don\u2019t know if Disney will keep <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496247/why-hamilton-on-disney-needs-to-keep-the-f-bombs\">the f-bombs</a> or censor the film to make it more suitable for all ages. We also don\u2019t know if they might make two versions available for families and one with original uncensored content. Disney+ has yet to release a trailer for their upcoming stage <em>Hamilton</em> film. This means we have no clue whether it\u2019ll be HD quality, take more of an audience view point, or something else. We do know that the production is supposed to cover multiple angles of the show. We don\u2019t know how the sound editing, mixing, and quality of the sound will turn out in the film. It could be a crisp sound--almost as good as a original soundtrack, or sound more like a live Broadway production, with audience laughs and all. We don\u2019t know if Disney will have an exclusive behind the scenes movie to accompany the staged <em>Hamilton</em> film<em>.</em> If they do add this additional film, we don\u2019t know if it will include interviews with the original cast or insight into Lin Manuel-Miranda\u2019s process for developing the musical. Disney+\u2019s staged <em>Hamilton</em> performance movie is one of the most anticipated movies of 2020. Partly because this is a very <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2491782/updated-list-of-major-movie-release-delays-and-early-digital-releases-due-to-coronavirus\">uncertain year for movies,</a> but mainly because <em>Hamilton</em> is an exciting show that many have wanted to see for years, but due to one thing or another, they weren\u2019t able to go see it. Now Disney is bringing a little bit of film magic back to the home with this exciting release. I, for one, can\u2019t wait to see how it all turns out.

I have been a life long lover of pop culture, especially television, turned that passion into writing about all things entertainment related.

    "title": "Suicide Squad And 6 Other Movies That Deserve The Snyder Cut Treatment",
    "content": "In case you\u2019ve been sitting to close to a Mother Box in the past week or so, there\u2019s been some pretty big news in the movie world. In accordance with the throngs of fans demanding Warner Bros\u2019 release \u201cThe Snyder Cut,\u201d HBO Max announced that <em>Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496562/release-the-snyder-cut-zack-snyders-justice-league-going-to-hbo-max\">would be heading to its platform</a> at some point in 2021. So it\u2019s time to relax and congratulate the internet on a job well done, right? Wrong! Utterly and categorically wrong! While I\u2019m not calling for <em>every</em> movie that has had production disagreements <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546656/the-snyder-cut-release-should-not-set-a-new-precedent-in-hollywood\">to get its own alternate cut</a>, there are seven movies that have earned their second chances based on similar circumstances. These films weren\u2019t always a result of disagreements, but here's a handful of cinematic curiosities that deserve the Snyder Cut treatment. Hoo-boy! You kind of <em>have</em> to start a list of infamous alternate cuts with director David Ayer\u2019s original vision for <em>Suicide Squad</em>. Not only is it a sibling case study to the eventual retooling that <em>Justice League</em> would go through, but even <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1545029/20-suicide-squad-shots-we-saw-in-trailers-that-didnt-make-the-final-cut\">just looking at the trailers</a> indicated that there was quite a bit missing from this one. With Ayer riding that Snyder Cut wave himself <a href=\"http://cinemablend.com/news/2546631/suicide-squad-director-posts-cryptic-joker-message-after-snyder-cut-is-announced\">on social media</a>, and teases of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496501/wait-suicide-squad-almost-gave-harley-quinn-a-love-triangle\">a love triangle</a> <em>and</em> more Jared Leto Joker action in the wings, HBO Max could get another hit under their belt with The Ayer Cut of <em>Suicide Squad.</em> Let\u2019s just go ahead and rip this particular band aid off in quick and succinct fashion as well! The original vision of Josh Trank\u2019s <em>Fantastic Four</em> film is something that\u2019s intrigued many a comic movie fan, and it was all thanks to the rather heated discussion that\u2019s surrounded this project since <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Josh-Trank-Responds-Fantastic-Four-Criticism-75827.html\">its release into Thursday previews</a> back in 2015. That \u201cfantastic\u201d version is something Trank doesn\u2019t think people will see, but if only to set fan\u2019s curiosities at ease, and to give the next iteration a clear slate to work off of, the ghosts of <em>Fantastic Four\u2019s</em> original cut should be put to rest once and for all. The temperature on the process of changes that made <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> the finished product it eventually became was moderately spicy. While there weren\u2019t any huge public displays of change, or even highly publicized firings like that of <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>, there was still a lot of retooling that altered things, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1637750/why-rogue-one-changed-its-original-happier-ending\">like the original \u201chappier\u201d ending</a>. Much like the original <em>Star Wars</em>, <em>Rogue One</em> was a movie apparently found in the editing room. It\u2019d be really neat to see how that initial version differed between the original intent and the finalized approach. Sometimes that seemingly perfect ending is evasive as all get out. <em>World War Z</em> is one of those cases where such an enterprise resulted in a radically different third act. We\u2019re talking an ending so different that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/How-World-War-Z-Originally-Ended-What-Happened-Matthew-Fox-38192.html\">Matthew Fox\u2019s presence in the film made more sense</a>, and everything from the second act plane crash onward played out differently, and in Russia. It might not make the Brad Pitt film any better, and it probably won\u2019t resurrect <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480598/david-finchers-world-war-z-2-would-have-been-really-good-according-to-brad-pitt\"><em>World War Z 2</em></a>, but you\u2019d be insane if you didn\u2019t think audiences would flock to see what could have been. Not every cut on this list is born of intense upset or pressured notes. When it came to Damon Lindelof and Brad Bird\u2019s Disney tentpole <em>Tomorrowland</em>, the film was altered to be a little more streamlined and audience friendly. However, deep cut fans of that film have, over time, discovered details <a href=\"https://www.tomorrowlandtimes.com/2018/05/everything-we-learned-from-tomorrowland.html\">from the original shooting script</a>, which have helped put together something known as \u201cThe Dreamer\u2019s Cut\u201d of the film. Using deleted materials from the Blu-Ray release, and those notes, a totally different version of this movie has yet to receive any official recognition from Disney. Five years later, it\u2019s about time everyone got to see \u201cThe Dreamer\u2019s Cut\u201d of <em>Tomorrowland</em>, exposed to the light of day. Even director Wes Craven has been subjected to the knives of studio executives; just ask anyone who\u2019s a fan of his PG-13 werewolf film <em>Cursed</em>. The mention of that rating is no mistake either, as Dimension Studios cut his contractually obligated R-rated film into a more \u201cmarket friendly\u201d product. That original cut is apparently still out there, with an executive from Dimension <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3530211/former-dimension-exec-thinks-first-cut-wes-cravens-cursed-totally-released-exclusive/\">swearing it still exists</a> in the studio\u2019s vault. With tons of actors, and a huge portion of the original plot, being excised, stories of the production\u2019s woes have built quite the narrative since the movie\u2019s 2004 release. Wes Craven may no longer be with us, but it\u2019d be nice to see one of his most infamous films get the edit it deserves. Last, but not least, we circle back to Warner Bros, as its troubles with a compromised final product stretch even farther than most would imagine. A dud upon its 1998, director Jeremiah Chechik\u2019s <em>The Avengers</em> adapted the \u201860s spy show of the same name into a total disaster. What was supposed to be a 115 minute movie was slashed to 89 minutes, junking a lot of scenes that still remain in the script and official novelization of Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes\u2019 would-be blockbuster. After 22 years later, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theavengers98/status/1263204618403811331\">it still waits to be restored,</a> with Chechik even offering to recut the film for free. If HBO Max is going to give <em>Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League</em> a spin, then why not bring the true vision of <em>The Avengers</em> to life? A lot of fans of various movies are going to be coming out of the woodwork and suggesting that their alternate cut should be the next big resurrection. But in the afterglow of <em>Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League</em>, these are the movies that feel like the most valid candidates for a second shot at telling another version of their story. <em>Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League</em> will be on HBO Max sometime in 2021, but who knows when, where or if any of these other films will get their own streaming debuts. One can only hope that if the Snyder Cut can prevail, others will follow in its footsteps. CinemaBlend's James Bond (expert).

    "title": "How Keanu Reeves' John Wick Made A Sacrifice To Not Compete With The Matrix 4",
    "content": "It was going to be a <em>Sophie's Choice</em> for modern movie audiences. Accepting that Keanu Reeves is one of the most <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475083/keanu-reeves-reacts-to-2019s-obsession-with-keanu-reeves?pv=search\">wonderful people on earth</a>, which, seems to be a given, then a new Keanu Reeves movie is a special day. But how would you handle it if two Keanu Reeves movies were set to debut on the same day? That's how things have been set up since late last year when the both <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em> and <em>The Matrix 4</em> were given <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2486600/keanu-reeves-showdown-the-matrix-4s-release-date-is-the-same-as-another-of-his-blockbusters\">the same release date,</a> May 21, 2021. How in the world would anybody choose? Luckily, now, we don't have to. Except that's also the bad news. As part of the perpetual reshuffling of movie release dates that we're seeing as studios continue to try and figure out what the post-pandemic movie world will look like, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lionsgate-sets-new-dates-john-wick-4-spiral-1292904\">THR</a> reports Lionsgate has pushed <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482592/john-wick-chapter-4-what-we-know-so-far?pv=search\"><em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em></a> back more than a year, and the film will now debut May 27, 2022. So now we don't need to worry about picking which Keanu movie we're going to watch first, but we have to wait a whole extra year for the next chapter of <em>John Wick</em>. It seemed like a shifting of a release date for either <em>John Wick 4</em> or <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495020/one-original-matrix-star-has-been-asking-lana-wachowski-to-join-matrix-4?pv=search\"><em>Matrix 4</em></a> was going to happen at some point. While the films were made by different studios and neither was beholden to the other, it was just an odd situation to be in. Considering that one major target audience for both films was obviously going to be \"Keanu Reeves fans\" both movies would take a hit on opening weekend and split that audience. We rarely see two major film releases of this size share a weekend, regardless of who is in the movies, because studios don't want to run the risk of losing out on box office to another strong competitor. At the same time, there was likely a bit of brinkmanship going on, as both studios also wanted to hold on to that key release date, not wanting to let the other studio have it. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484311/john-wick-chapter-3s-dvd-and-blu-ray-sales-are-really-helping-lionsgate?pv=search\">Lionsgate</a> is the one that blinked first, but under the circumstances it's not that surprising. <em>John Wick Chapter 4</em> hadn't begun production yet, so it was easier to move. And it's still possible that <em>The Matrix 4</em> will also let that release date go, as the movie is one of those that had to stop production due to the pandemic, and depending on when things can get underway again, it may be difficult for the movie to be finished in time. While there certainly would have been some competition between the two films if they had opened together, there's still a great deal of support between the makers of the two films, as <em>John Wick</em> franchise director Chad Stahelski is still <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495383/the-john-wick-directors-are-helping-out-on-the-matrix-4?pv=search\">helping out Lana Wachowski</a> on <em>The Matrix 4</em> as well as working on his own film. Who knows, maybe, if <em>The Matrix 4</em> also ends up needing to push back its opening by a year, and then we can still have Keanu Reeves Day in May 2022.

On the off chance you live stateside and missed <em>Uncut Gems</em>\u2019 time in theaters, not to worry, because if you have a Netflix subscription, you can now stream the movie in the comfort of your own home. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493744/uncut-gems-finally-has-a-netflix-premiere-date\"><em>Uncut Gems</em> dropped on Netflix in the United States</a> several days ago, and a lot of folks visited the streaming service to either check out the movie for the first time or give it a re-watch. Either way, the result was plenty of chatter on social media about not just <em>Uncut Gems</em> as a whole, but specifically Adam Sandler\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492623/Uncut-Gems-Directors-Howard-Ratner-Adam-Sandler-Coronavirus-Outbreak?pv=related_list\">performance as Howard Ratner</a>, a jeweler with a gambling addiction who has to retrieve an expensive gem he bought to pay off his debts. Adam Sandler received a lot of acclaim for his work in <em>Uncut Gems</em>, and one only needs to browse Twitter for a bit to be reminded of this. Take this person: Yes, despite so much praise being thrown his way, Adam Sandler did not score an Oscar nomination for <em>Uncut Gems</em>, though <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489439/after-uncut-gems-snub-adam-sandler-continues-to-dominate-on-netflix?pv=related_list\">he had a pretty good response to the snub</a>. In fact, <em>Uncut Gems</em> didn\u2019t get any Academy Award recognition whatsoever, but don\u2019t think that means it isn\u2019t worth your time. That said, maybe don\u2019t watch the movie if you\u2019re <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493950/uncut-gems-and-other-anxiety-inducing-movies?pv=related_list\">already anxious</a>. As the below Twitter user put it: This person also felt similarly stressed out by <em>Uncut Gems</em>, and while she liked the movie overall, she wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of Howard Ratner. In any case, the overall consensus is that <em>Uncut Gems</em> is one of Adam Sandler\u2019s best movies yet, although to reiterate, it\u2019s definitely <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2488977/why-dramas-like-uncut-gems-are-harder-for-adam-sandler?pv=related_list\">outside his wheelhouse</a>.

But a replacement has already been found in <em>Doctor Strange</em>'s Scott Derrickson. Derrickson isn't set to return for <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>, which presumably opened up his schedule for this new exciting project. This latest <em>Labyrinth 2</em> update comes to us from <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/labyrinth-sequel-scott-derrickson-director-maggie-levin-write-script-doctor-strange-1202943188/\">Deadline</a>, and is sure to be exciting for the generations of moviegoers who were brought up on Jim Henson's original movie. Fede Alvarez's departure had the potential to derail the movie's development process, so it's a relief to see that another filmmaker has stepped in to make the upcoming sequel into a reality. What's more, Scott Derrickson's work in <em>Doctor Strange</em> proved how he could tackle a story with high concepts, and out of this world characters. Scott Derrickson <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2488207/doctor-strange-director-scott-derrickson-breaks-silence-on-leaving-the-multiverse-of-madness\">turned down the opportunity</a> to return to the MCU and direct <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>, citing creative differences with Marvel Studios. But the sequel is still going full speed ahead, with <em>Spider-Man</em> director Sam Raimi <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489774/doctor-stranges-scott-derrickson-comments-on-sam-raimi-possibly-taking-over-the-multiverse-of-madness\">returning to the superhero genre</a> to helm Stephen Strange's second solo flick in the MCU. While Marvel fans are bummed that Scott Derrickson won't be back in the MCU for <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,</em> it should be interesting to see what he brings to <em>Labyrinth 2</em>. The first movie is both bonkers and iconic, featuring a variety of creatures created by Jim Henson. There will also be <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478385/see-the-first-look-at-david-bowie-in-upcoming-musical-biopic-stardust\">a David Bowie sized hole</a> in the upcoming sequel, so perhaps another big star will take his place in the upcoming sequel.

Kong</em></a>. Although the franchise has already used three films to lead into the epic movie, a new tie-in comic book prequel to the film has been released, and it introduces an intimidating new Titan. It\u2019s always fun to see new Titans in the MonsterVerse and, during the Legendary Comics <a class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"e2b58d8c868790a18d8ca2aa8d8f87\" href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\">[email protected]</a> panel, the latest terrifying addition was revealed on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KaijuNewsOutlet/status/1263617774867353600\">social media</a>. It\u2019s called Titanus Camazotz and is described as darkness and the embodiment of nightmares. Check it out for yourself: This isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve been potentially teased with new Titans in <em>Godzilla Vs. Kong</em>. Earlier this year, photos of a toy <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494095/godzilla-vs-kong-merchandise-seemingly-reveals-another-monster-heading-to-the-big-screen\">Nozuki</a>, a large snake-like monster with wings, surfaced online, and there have also been <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2487983/godzilla-vs-kong-might-be-bringing-in-an-iconic-kaiju\">pictures of Mechagodzilla merchandise</a> that have surfaced before being taken down. This isn\u2019t to say any of these Titans will actually appear in <em>Godzilla Vs. Kong</em>, since a number of toys are sometimes introduced solely for the purpose of expanding toylines. Still, fans love to speculate regardless whenever a new Titan appears online. Some may be under the impression that it's easy to create or update Titans, and that's not truly the case. In <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2472382/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-review\"><em>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</em></a><em>,</em> Godzilla had no lack of Titans to face off against, including the iconic Mothra, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471249/new-godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-video-unleashes-rodan-onto-the-world\">Rodan</a>, and Ghidorah, and a lot of time and effort went into developing them. As it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471880/why-mothra-was-difficult-to-design-for-godzilla-king-of-the-monsters\">Mothra was the most difficult to design</a> in the movie due to its simplicity in the originals. They tried to give her feminine power versus the other monsters\u2019 hypermasculinity. Similarly, the design for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2472282/godzilla-king-of-the-monsters-made-sure-ghidorah-didnt-look-like-other-dragons\">Ghidorah was difficult, but not because of simplicity</a>. The director was afraid he would look too much like an average dragon, like in <em>Game of Thrones.</em> So, to avoid being ho-hum, director Michael Dougherty gave him human characteristics. Audiences enjoyed seeing Titans like Mothra and Ghidora on the big screen in <em>King of the Monsters</em> and are looking forward to seeing them again, but the road for <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> hasn't been an easy one. Late last year, it was announced that the release date for <em>Godzilla Vs. Kong</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485616/godzilla-vs-kong-has-been-delayed\">would be delayed</a> to ensure that it would be an \u201cA+ movie.\u201d This makes sense considering that the studio has a lot riding on its success, as it could help determine the trajectory of the MonsterVerse going forward. While originally scheduled to be released on May 29, Godzilla vs. Kong is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494639/quick-things-we-know-about-godzilla-vs-kong\">now scheduled to hit theaters</a> on November 20th. You can bet <em>Godzilla</em> and <em>King Kong</em> fans will be waiting with bated breath until that time and, when it arrives, we'll finally see which other Titans, if any, will appear.

    "title": "Birds Of Prey Concept Art Reveals Comic Book Accurate Look For Huntress",
    "content": "The DC Extended Universe has had a fascinating tenure in theaters, full of peaks and valleys. But over the past few years, Warner Bros. has seemingly found its stride and released a slew of critically acclaimed blockbusters. The most recent of which was Cathy Yan's <em>Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</em>, which introduced Margot Robbie's title character to a group of female friends. Chief among them was Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Huntress, and new concept art recently revealed a more comic book accurate version of her costume. <em>Birds of Prey</em> had a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481710/birds-of-preys-mary-elizabeth-winstead-teases-the-directors-unique-vision\">unique visual language</a>, full of bright colors and top notch narration by Harley Quinn herself. The characters were <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2488540/birds-of-preys-rosie-perez-was-worried-about-costumes-til-she-found-out-she-wouldnt-have-to-wear-hot-pants\">given modern costumes</a>, which were a bit more realistic than the costumes from the source material. This includes Huntress' appearance, although unused concept art revealed a much more comic book accurate appearance. Check it out below. FOMO alert. This version of Huntress is a bit more dramatic than the one we saw in <em>Birds of Prey</em>, especially where the character's mask is concerned. It's definitely a great visual, although it might have prevented some of Mary Elizabeth Winstead's facial expressions from coming across on screen. Instead she was given a helmet, which she removed to allow for her to fully emote throughout the character's badass action and socially awkward personality. This new <em>Bids of Prey</em> concept art comes to us from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greghops\">the social media</a> of artist Greg Hopwood. Hopwood has worked as a concept artist on high-profile projects like <em>BoP</em> and <em>Star Trek: Picard</em>, helping the filmmakers find a visual language and design for its characters. While the above art of Huntress was obviously unused, it helped to create the world of Cathy Yan's DC blockbuster, which definitely had some striking costumes and cinematography. In the concept art, we see Huntress in a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2487511/the-story-behind-harley-quinns-wild-caution-tape-jacket-costumes-birds-of-prey\">more dramatic costume</a>, although it's still a mixture of black and very dark violet colors. This costume most notably includes Huntress' signature mask, which she's known for rocking in DC comics as a member of the Bat-family. The head piece was hinted at with the character's helmet, but she spent the majority of <em>Birds of Prey</em>'s 109-minute runtime noticeably mask-less. Huntress did get an upgraded costume <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489758/birds-of-prey-ending-explained-what-happened-and-what-does-it-mean\">in the final moments</a> of <em>Birds of Pre</em>y, where Harley Quinn is revealing the fate of the team. Huntress, Black Canary, and Renee Montoya formed the titular group of crimefighters, rocking new duds in the process. This brief scene gave <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495073/birds-of-prey-methodically-approached-bringing-black-canarys-power-to-the-big-screen\">both Black Canary</a> and Huntress more comic book accurate costumes, debuting as bonafide superheroes in the process. I'm personally eager to see the trio return to the big screen in another installment in the DCEU, although whether or not that happens remains to be seen. It'll be interesting to see how <em>Bird of Prey</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492717/birds-of-prey-is-hitting-homes-early-too\">early home release</a> affects these odds. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was definitely a scene stealer in <em>Birds of Prey</em>, as her character was seriously lacking in social intelligence due to her isolation and training as an assassin. She added a unique dynamic to the group, and ultimately found herself in the process. The next installment in the DCEU is <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> on August 14th.

    "title": "Dakota Johnson Says Grandmother Tippi Hedren Still Lives With Lions And Tigers",
    "content": "Most Americans have a few cats or dogs to keep as pets, and maybe a goldfish, but never lions and tigers. Still, with the popularity of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2494931/wait-tiger-king-isnt-the-biggest-netflix-hit-right-now\"><em>Tiger King</em></a>, the public has been intrigued by people who live with exotic animals and, as it turns out, Hollywood icon Tippi Hedren is one of those people. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Watch-Tippi-Hedren-Screen-Test-Birds-33856.html\">Tippi Hedren</a>, famed for her work in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s <em>The Birds</em> and the totally bonkers movie <em>Roar</em>, has been adopting and keeping lions and tigers since the early '80s. Now, her granddaughter Dakota Johnson says Hedren still lives with lions and tigers, though she doesn't possess quite as many as she did back in the day: Tippi Hedren and her then husband Noel Marshall started <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Watch-Lions-Attack-Melanie-Griffith-Her-Family-Terrifying-Roar-Trailer-70215.html\">collecting big cats for <em>Roar</em></a><em>.</em> The production involved 70 members of the cast and crew being around untrained wild animals while they were filming and, of course, resulted in several severe injuries. Yet despite all that, Tippi Hedren still keeps the animals around. While on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWZCbICzOFg\"><em>The Graham Norton Show</em></a>, Dakota Johnson also pointed out that there weren't as many big cats around when she was growing up, as most had been relocated to compounds: Dakota Johnson\u2019s mother, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Dakota-Johnson-Doesn-t-Want-Her-Mom-See-Fifty-Shades-Grey-68500.html\">Melanie Griffith</a>, had a starring role in <em>Roar</em>. Sadly, like many of the other cast and crew members, Griffith was attacked and needed to have facial reconstructive surgery. Tippi Hedren didn\u2019t leave the production unscathed, either, suffering a broken leg. Jan Du Bont, the director of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Keanu-Doesn-t-Care-About-Speed-But-Wants-More-Bill-Ted-11107.html\"><em>Speed</em></a>, served as the film's cinematographer and was scalped by a lion. Yet, despite the risks the cast and crew took to make <em>Roar</em>, it only took in $2 million dollars on a budget of $17 million. <em>Roar</em>, of course, isn\u2019t the only film that Tippi Hedren has worked on that involved nature at the center of the story. As previously mentioned, she first starred in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Tippi-Hedren-Calls-Alfred-Hitchcock-Evil-Talks-Sexual-Harassment-32271.html\">Alfred Hitchcock's</a> <em>The Birds</em>, a film that saw her protagonist face off with some rogue birds in a small town. Dakota Johnson definitely has <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/Meet-Dakota-Johnson-10-Things-Know-About-Fifty-Shades-Grey-Star-64359.html\">an interesting family</a> and, believe it or not, her grandmother's love of big cats is only the tip of the iceberg. Still, it's good to hear there weren't too many large felines around when Johnson was born. Having lions and tigers around a small child may not have been the best idea. Fans of Dakota Johnson can check out her latest film, <em>The High Note</em>, which will be released on VOD on May 29.

    "title": "Sweet Magnolias Ending: 7 Major Questions We Have After Season 1",
    "content": "<em>Sweet Magnolias</em> is the new hit <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/netflix\">Netflix</a> series that follows three lifelong friends: Maddie (JoAnna Garcia), Helen (Heather Headley), and Dana Sue (Brooke Elliott). The series opens with Maddie in the middle of a major divorce, as she becomes the latest town gossip star. <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> Season 1 follows the women as they deal with romantic relationships, motherhood, their friendship, and running their businesses. Though the new series had a relatively quiet first season in terms of major twists, it saved all the explosive moments for the <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> ending. The ending left us wanting more, and holding our margaritas, as we wait for news of a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2460075/what-netflix-has-cancelled-and-renewed\">renewal for another season.</a> The season finale left us with tons of questions, so let us freak out together and ponder what could be ahead for <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> Season 2. <strong>Warning: I will be discussing</strong> <em><strong>Sweet Magnolias</strong></em> <strong>Season 1 spoilers. If you haven\u2019t finished the season, then continue on but know that you\u2019ll be majorly spoiled.</strong> This is probably the biggest question haunting <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> fans right now. The season ended with Bill (Chris Klein), Maddie, Dana Sue, Helen, and Ronnie (Brandon Quinn) rushing to a car accident involving Kyle (Logan Allen) and a mysterious passenger. Last we saw Kyle, Jackson (Sam Ashby) took over his friend's date with Jackson\u2019s sister Nellie (Simone Lockhart) to throw a prom afterparty. Jackson and Tyler (Carson Rowland) got into a fight after Jackson kept teasing Annie (Anneliese Judge) about her drunk phone call to Tyler. Kyle jumped in to help his brother, and Tyler told him to stay out of it. Kyle yelled about Tyler ignoring him, and then he took off running. Tyler, Nellie, Annie, CeCe (Harlan Drum), and Annie\u2019s date Simon (Michael May) were all running after Kyle. This means one of these people are likely to be the passenger. I believe <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> could take three routes with this storyline. The first (and most likely route) is that Tyler is the passenger. He may have run after his brother and jumped into the car with him before Kyle crashed. If it is Tyler in the car, I don\u2019t think either brother will die from this accident, but I think Tyler could get hurt and have his arm damaged so bad that he can\u2019t play baseball anymore. If that's the case, It\u2019ll likely cause a major barrier between the two brothers. Kyle would feel guilty, and Tyler might be bitter towards him because of it. The other route that I think could happen is that Annie is the passenger. Again, she'd likely be hurt, but survive. However, in this scenario, the accident would hurt Dana Sue and Maddie\u2019s friendship. Maybe making next season about them trying to repair it because of Kyle\u2019s actions, and losing trust with each other. The least likely option is that Nellie is in the car and dies. It seems like the most dramatic possibility, and would lead to a lot of legal drama and darkness that I don't think Sweet <em>Magnolias</em> really wants to tackle. Simon or CeCe being the passenger makes zero sense, so those two as choices seem the least likely. Before Dana Sue got a call about the accident, Isaac (Chris Medlin) asked her if she was his mother. He assumed this after seeing her flirty friendship with Micah (Marland Burke). The viewers didn\u2019t see her response to his question, instead we saw the aftermath of them having a heartfelt moment. Now, here\u2019s my theory on Isaac\u2019s parents. They are not Dana Sue and Micah. My theory is that they are Peggy (Brittany L. Smith) and possibly Ryan (Michael Shenefelt). I suspected that Peggy might be Isaac\u2019s mother during the episode where the prom picture was brought up, and Peggy got nervous and said her family was away at that time. In the finale, Peggy was very cryptic with Helen. She said she knew her pain, and if they were friends, she would know what she meant. Peggy also seems to hate the Sweet Magnolias, but we have no clue why. She seemed happy that Helen finally lost Ryan, so that is why I think Ryan being the dad is a possibility. Helen and Ryan had an on-again-off-again relationship most of their lives. Maybe at one point in their off-phase, Ryan and Peggy hooked up when they were teens. She became pregnant, and left Serenity to have the baby in secret. Following this theory, I don\u2019t believe that Ryan knew she was pregnant and had their child, but I think it would be ironic if the man so set against being a father, finds out that he is one. <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> made me adore Erik (Dion Johnstone) and Helen, only to have Ryan come back and interrupt <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493276/the-17-best-romantic-movies-and-where-to-stream-or-rent-them-online\">their budding romance.</a> Ryan wasn\u2019t nearly as horrible as I hoped, but I\u2019m glad that Helen and him are over. I believe this will lead to Erik and Helen growing closer. Will they move forward with a friendship that slow burns into romance? This is definitely something we need to see more over if Season 2 happens. <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> started Season 1 as a love triangle between Tyler, Annie, and Kyle. Kyle liked Annie, but she liked Tyler. Tyler just saw her as a little sister figure. Now, everything I know about TV <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/30-Best-Romantic-Comedies-All-Time-43134.html\">and movie romances</a> tells me that Tyler will start to like Annie at some point. Kyle is out of the triangle because he\u2019s clearly being set up to have a romance with Nellie. Kyle is out and Simon is in, and so is Cece. Currently, it's hard to tell the true depth of Tyler's interest in CeCe -- is he really into her, or does he just want a girlfriend? -- but he could start to develop feelings for her too. Annie also doesn\u2019t seem extremely into Simon, but that could also change. So we have a lot of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/30-Best-Romantic-Comedies-All-Time-43134.html\">potential teen drama</a> coming in Season 2. I believe that eventually all of this is leading to Annie and Tyler ending up together but possibly not until Season 2 or later. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2546738/how-getting-pregnant-at-16-influenced-jamie-lynn-spears-sweet-magnolias-character-on-netflix\">Noreen (Jamie Lynn Spears)</a> made the biggest boss move of the season by finally realizing Bill was no good for her, and returning to her family. Now, of course, Noreen has to return at some point, even if to drop off the kid to give Bill his visitation rights. The question more so is will she ever return to Bill as his girlfriend/wife. If I had to guess, I say probably not. I don\u2019t think she wants any part of Bill (rightfully), and she never quite fit in in Serenity. It's too soon to know if Jamie Lynn Spears will be upped from special guest star to series regular, but it's possible Noreen will make a few appearances in Season 2 and not as a main resident of Serenity. First off, I feel personally attacked by the <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> casting team for casting Tommy Dawkins (Brandon Quinn) as Ronnie. I\u2019m always going to root for Brandon Quinn when I see him in stuff. I went into the season, not meeting Ronnie, but very sure that I'd hate him, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Syfy-Signs-Series-Based-Graphic-Novel-67880.html\">then <em>Big Wolf on Campus</em></a> walks in as Ronnie, and now I have to root for Ronnie and Dana Sue. I also have to believe that the writers are also on that team. Jeremy (Chase Anderson) was thrown into the show at the last minute. So, I, Dana Sue, and other viewers don\u2019t really have any attachment to him as a character, so it doesn\u2019t seem like the writers want us to love him the way we have grown to love Cal (Justin Bruening) and Erik. They also made a point to show the chemistry that still exists between Ronnie and Dana Sue, and that he might actually be trying to make amends to her for his past. If any of the Sweet Magnolias are going to get back with their no-good exes, my guess is that it will be Dana Sue with Ronnie. At least that\u2019s what I hope (but I'm not happy about rooting for them). Bill asked Maddie to give him another chance. Then they got a call about Kyle and the accident. She had just broken up with Cal, and Noreen was long gone. Logically, and reasonably, Maddie should laugh in his face and say \u201cHell no!\u201d But everything I know about TV exes, when kids are involved, tells me that Maddie might actually try to make it work with Bill. However, she\u2019ll eventually realize that it\u2019s a mistake and dump him... and get back together with Cal. At least that\u2019s where I believe the show is heading with Bill wanting her back, but I would love to see the laughing in his face and a hard-cold rejection. <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> is just the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2546831/what-to-watch-on-netflix-if-you-liked-sweet-magnolias\">engaging and heartfelt series</a> to kick off your summer. It\u2019s still unknown whether Netflix will send it to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2546807/cancelled-netflix-favorite-is-getting-resurrected-on-cable-channel\">the land of cancellations</a> or give it another season, but I hope it gets a renewal order, especially with all those cliffhangers.

The actress\u2019 roles have only increased in variety since, in front of and behind the camera, such as the 2019 romantic comedy <em>Can You Keep a Secret?</em>, which she <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/alexandra-daddario-producing-can-you-keep-a-secret-1130370\">both starred in and served as executive producer</a> for. There are even more interesting things to learn about this talented beauty beyond the big (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2478009/why-women-kill-review-its-sexy-mystery-time-with-lucy-liu-ginnifer-goodwin-and-cbs-all-access\">or small</a>) screen. Just take these six enlightening bits of Alexandra Daddario trivia as evidence. Despite starting out quite early at just 16 years old as part of the cast of <em>All My Children</em>, acting was not the first <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/331339/Interview-Bereavement-Alexandra-Daddario\">career aspiration for Alexandra Daddario</a>, who was born on March 16, 1986, to Richard and Christina Daddario, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/nyregion/25appoint.html\">are both well-known attorneys</a>. In 2013, after being asked by <a href=\"https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/alexandra-daddario\">Interview Magazine</a> if she was \"the black sheep\" of the family growing up, the actress replied that a career in law was actually something on her mind given her upbringing, but thankfully, her parents responded well to her eventual decision to pursue acting instead. She even cites her mother's early days as a model as a possible reason for the support. At 34, Alexandra Daddario is the oldest of three children, all of whom have defied their parents' law-based influence and went on to lead acting careers. While the youngest sibling, 27-year-old Catharine, has <a href=\"http://www.summerafternunes.com/spotlight/2018/8/16/catharine-daddario\">earned modest success so far</a> with TV appearances and roles in small film productions, <a href=\"http://rawpages.com/2017/08/matthew-daddario-interview/\">Alexandra's younger brother</a>, Matthew Daddario, has already been hitting it big in films like <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Delivery-Man-6650.html\"><em>Delivery Man</em></a>, opposite Vince Vaughn, and the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Cabin-Fever-Remake-Looks-Like-Exact-Same-Movie-109317.html\">2016 update of Eli Roth's <em>Cabin Fever</em></a>. Yet, the 32-year-old really rose in popularity from <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2471030/will-shadowhunters-magnus-and-alec-get-a-happy-ending-in-the-series-finale\">playing Alec Lightwood on <em>Shadowhunters</em></a>, Freeform's supernatural series based on Cassandra Clare's <em>The Mortal Instruments</em> books. Even after <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/268929/Interview-Chris-Columbus-Cast-Percy-Jackson\">breaking out in 2010 as Annabeth</a>, the daughter of Athena, in <em>Percy &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief</em>, Alexandra Daddario claims that her career really began to take off until <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Alexandra-Daddario-Elizabeth-Reaser-2-More-Join-HBO-True-Detective-51427.html\">she appeared on the first season of HBO's <em>True Detective</em></a>. After struggling to be taken seriously as an actress for years, she began to earn more attention after playing Lisa Tragnetti, who is often remembered for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/True-Detective-Hired-2-Porn-Stars-Wild-Orgy-Scene-Get-Details-70783.html\">her nude scene</a> on the highly acclaimed anthology crime drama. Despite the risk she knew she was taking, Daddario would reveal to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/alexandra-daddario-we-summon-darkness-fighting-true-detective-1289861\">THR</a> years later that it was worth, stating the following: One of Alexandra Daddario's biggest roles to date is Blake Gaines, the resilient daughter of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/555519/Face-Rock-Makes-Escaping-From-An-Earthquake\">Los Angeles rescue pilot Ray</a> (Dwayne Johnson), in the \"groundbreaking\" disaster flick <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/San-Andreas-66593.html?pv=search\"><em>San Andreas</em></a>. The actress actually had some early preparation for her performance, having endured several earthquakes since moving to LA, but none as cataclysmic as what takes place in the 2015 film (the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494312/san-andreas-2-alexandra-daddario-still-sounds-game-for-sequel-with-dwayne-johnson\">follow-up of which has been announced</a>). In an interview with <a href=\"denofgeek\">Den of Geek</a>, Daddario described the \"little\" events as nothing major, with no damage caused, and her frightened pet dog jumping into her arms as the worst of the ordeal. After co-starring once again with her onscreen father as a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1645209/the-baywatch-movie-is-going-to-have-a-lo?jwsource=cl\">fellow lifeguard in 2017's <em>Baywatch</em></a>, Alexandra Daddario almost had her second reunion with Dwayne Johnson the following year in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1699532/why-san-andreas-2-hasnt-been-made-yet\">director Brad Peyton's follow-up to <em>San Andreas</em>, <em>Rampage</em></a>. However, the actress never made it into the theatrical cut of the hilarious <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2400862/rampage-review\">B-movie adaptation of the popular arcade game</a>. The brief cameo which was left on the cutting room floor sees Daddario and her supposed boyfriend, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1688640/the-wtf-moment-hot-rods-creators-were-asked-to-cut-from-the-movie\">played by The Lonely Island's Jorma Taccone</a>, preparing for a deep sea dive, which leads to hints that their relaxation expedition may soon lead to trouble, as you can see from the clip below: When she is not saving the world from mythological creatures, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/508809/Dwayne-Johnson-Nabs-True-Detective-Beauty-Alexandra-Daddario-San-Andreas\">natural disasters</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/618759/Rock-Baywatch-Movie-Just-Found-Perfect-Actress-Play-Summer\">unruly beach combers</a>, while off screen, Alexandra Daddario likes to put in the time to make a real difference in the world as an activist participating in several helpful causes. In fact, on her own birthday in 2018, she decided to be the one to give a gift. She dedicated her own time to help the United Nations Foundation\u2019s Nothing But Nets campaign and The Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation <a href=\"https://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/03/prweb15325967.htm\">raise funds to provide children with nets</a> to protect them from disease-carrying mosquitos in Malawi, an African nation that the actress had previously visited as a humanitarian effort.

    "title": "Amy Adams: 10 Movie And TV Appearances You May Have Forgotten About",
    "content": "In the last ten or so years, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/amy-adams\">Amy Adams</a> has become one of the most talented and recognizable figures in Hollywood thanks to her undeniable charm and the boundless talent. With roles like Lois Lane in <em>Man Of Steel</em> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/dceu\">the rest of the DCEU</a>, Camille Preaker in <em>Sharp Objects</em>, and Dr. Louise Banks in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1626170/arrival-ending-one-exciting-mystery-has-now-been-solved\"><em>Arrival</em></a>, the six-time Academy Award nominee has been just about everywhere. But just like her character Julie Powell in Nora Ephron's 2009 film <em>Julie And Julia</em>, Amy Adams didn't become a worldwide sensation overnight. No, it took a lot of bit roles in popular TV shows, direct to video sequels, and a few box office juggernauts for Amy Adams to get where she is today. And along the way there are probably some performances that many of you may have forgotten (don't worry, I'm in your numbers). So, let's take a look at some of Amy Adam's forgotten appearances on television and movies. Although she only appeared in three episodes in the first two seasons of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2493700/what-the-office-cast-is-doing-now\"><em>The Office</em></a>, Amy Adams gave an incredible albeit brief performance as Katy, the handbag saleswoman who became Jim Halpert's girlfriend. The relationship would come crashing down during the iconic \"Booze Cruise\" episode in Season 2 thus ending Adams' involvement in the NBC comedy series. The actress had yet to become the star we know her as today when she first appeared in the early runnings of <em>The Office</em>, but she would become a household name in a few short years. I didn't realize Amy Adams was in Steven Spielberg's 2002 biographical film thriller <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484853/the-10-best-tom-hanks-movies-ranked\"><em>Catch Me If You Can</em></a> until years after the film's release, but yeah, she's there. Portraying Brenda Strong, the one-time love interest of Leonardo DiCaprio's Frank Abagnale, Adams is almost unrecognizable at times due to makeup and a mouth full of braces made to make the actress look much younger. But through the braces and naivety, you see flashes of what was to come for the talented actress in the near future. And she pulls off the performance of the young and innocent nurse quite well even when she betrays Abagnale at the Miami airport. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2490937/amazing-90s-movies-no-one-ever-talks-about-anymore\"><em>Drop Dead Gorgeous</em></a> was Amy Adams' first on-screen appearance, though her portrayal of the beautiful yet ditzy cheerleader Leslie Miller in 1999 mockumentary about a beauty pageant and its contestants makes it seem like she's a seasoned pro. In a cast that includes the likes of Kirsten Dunst, Allison Janney, Brittany Murphy, Denise Richards, and Kirstie Alley, it would be easy to get lost in the shuffle. But not Adams, who steals every scene <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_-Id45lLXQ\">in which she is featured</a>, especially when she thinks the interviewer is asking about her possible pregnancy and not pre-pageant jitters. Everyone from Nathan Fillon to John Ritter appeared on Joss Whedon's groundbreaking teenage paranormal series <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/buffy-the-vampire-slayer\"><em>Buffy The Vampire Slayer</em></a>, but did you know that even Amy Adams appeared on the show. In the Season 5 episode \"Family,\" Adams portrayed Tara Maclay's (Amber Benson) cousin Beth, who tries to get the witch to leave the Scooby Gang and come back home with her family. And shortly after her appearance on the show, Adams would go on to take on a role popularized by Buffy herself, Sarah Michelle Gellar in the direct to video <em>Cruel Intentions 2</em>... Originally filmed as a Fox television series that was re-edited into a feature film in 2001, <em>Cruel Intentions 2</em> is more of a prequel than a sequel of the late-90s teenage drama about the rich and powerful students of a New York City prep school. With none of the original cast returning for this direct-to-video affair, director Roger Kumble turned to a young, relatively unknown Amy Adams to take on the role of the cruel and devious Kathryn Merteuil, the character made famous two years earlier by Sarah Michelle Gellar. Amy Adams' <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2463136/amy-adams-thinks-shes-out-of-the-dc-universe\">portrayal of Lois Lane in the DCEU</a> is probably one of the best things about the franchise, but <em>Man Of Steel</em> wasn't the first time the actress showed up in a Superman property. Way back in 2001, more than a decade before she'd play Daily Planet reporter and Superman's love interest, Adams appeared on <em>Smallville</em> where she played Jodi Melville, a teenager who inherited some pretty crazy powers from kryptonite-laced shakes. Covered in terrible and a bodysuit for much of her one episode, Adams has some pretty unintentionally funny scenes like the one where <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpdd_kKNsus\">she devours an entire deer</a> and the one where she tries to suck someone's fat out of their body. You have to start somewhere, and for Amy Adams, that place was <em>That '70s Show</em> (as far as television appearances are concerned). In the episode \"Burning Down The House,\" Adams plays Kat Peterson, one of the popular girls and friends of Mila Kunis' Jackie Burkhart who changes her tune concerning Danny Masterson's Steven Hyde at one of Jackie's parties. And despite this being a one-and-done role for the character, this was just the beginning of a great career for the six-time Oscar nominee. Amy Adams was <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/2471530/amy-adams-what-fans-should-know\">nominated for yet another Academy Award</a> for her portrayal of Lynne Cheney in the 2018 biographical drama <em>Vice</em>, but this wasn't the first time she and director Adam McKay had worked together. The two first crossed paths in McKay's 2006 Will Ferrell comedy <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464096/how-making-vice-compared-to-talladega-nights-for-amy-adams\"><em>Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby</em></a>, in which Adams played Susan, the assistant-turned-lover of the embattled NASCAR driver. Showing that she had the chops for comedy, Adams is great in her role of the shy and nervous personal assistant with an edgy side. I guess we can go ahead and add <em>Charmed</em> to the list of one-off appearances by Amy Adams in the early 2000s. Appearing in an episode in the show's second season, Adams portrayed Maggie Murphy, a down-on-her-luck woman almost driven to suicide after falling under the control of Spirit Killer. The character, like many Adams has played over the years, was kind and thoughtful despite her bad luck. Aaron Sorkin's groundbreaking political drama series <em>The West Wing</em> featured some of the biggest names in film and television during its seven-season run, but did you know that even Amy Adams appeared on the show at one point? In the Season 4 two-part episode \"20 Hours In America,\" Adams played Cathy, the daughter of a farm family helping President Josiah Bartlet's reelection campaign in rural Indiana. Although not as remembered as some of her later roles, Adams gives a convincing performance as a farmer's daughter in this 2002 episode. Those are just 10 of Amy Adams' forgotten film and television appearances. What crazy to me is that she didn't follow the same path as so many other A-list actors and actresses by making a brief guest appearance on an episode of <em>Law &amp; Order</em> over the years. But if you're looking to see who did just that, check out <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2489968/law-and-order-actors-who-appeared-on-the-show-before-they-were-famous\">this piece on some of the biggest names to appear</a> on the show here on CinemaBlend. Philip grew up in Louisiana (not New Orleans) before moving to St. Louis after graduating from Louisiana State University-Shreveport. When he's not writing about movies or television, Philip can be found being chased by his three kids, telling his dogs to stop yelling at the mailman, or yelling about professional wrestling to his wife.

    "title": "Sounds Like The Cast Of Tenet Was Also Confused By The Film\u2019s Plot",
    "content": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s <em>Tenet</em> is shaping up to be one of the most intriguing films of the year, with many having been impressed by <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546638/tenets-new-trailer-finally-reveals-what-christopher-nolans-movie-is-about\">the film\u2019s trailers</a>. Not much is known about the plot, except that it\u2019ll involve time inversion and, although <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496115/tenets-robert-pattinson-shuts-down-major-theory-about-christopher-nolans-new-movie\">people are speculating</a>, no one seems to have cracked the story. However, fans aren\u2019t alone in trying to decipher what Nolan\u2019s latest tale is about, as the film\u2019s stars even found it tricky to stay on track. Tenet star John David Washington admitted that he always he always had questions for Christopher Nolan while they were shooting the film. Luckily, it sounds like Nolan was more than accommodating when it came to explaining the plot to his cast: Following the latest trailer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDOIFkpjHw4&amp;feature=emb_logo\">release on Fortnite</a>, John David Washington opened up about certain aspects of the movie. This included just <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546766/tenets-star-was-surprised-christopher-nolan-revealed-so-much-information-in-the-new-trailer\">how surprised he was</a> at how much was revealed in the trailer. Still, the new footage didn\u2019t divulge enough for audiences to piece together the actual story. Plot details have been kept firmly under wraps, which is typical when it comes to Christopher Nolan\u2019s projects. Based on the footage we\u2019ve seen so far, we can gather that John David Washington plays an agent tasked with stopping World War III. And during his mission, he learns the inversion of time is crucial to his mission. Christopher Nolan is a cerebral writer/director to say the least, and many of his features leave moviegoers pondering things long after they\u2019ve left the theater. Films like <em>Inception</em> and <em>Interstellar</em> have encouraged us to consider the world we live in and how it relates to us. Meanwhile, <em>The Dark Knight</em> Trilogy Nolan asked fans to consider themes like morality and anarchy. Nolan collaborator Lee Smith, who has served as editor on many of his films, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493081/christopher-nolan-movies-are-complicated-but-theres-a-secret-to-making-them\">has even acknowledged</a> how some viewers can get lost while watching them. This is why he believes his main job is to make the projects as understandable as possible to audiences, all while maintaining Nolan\u2019s vision. With its seemingly complex themes and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546792/christopher-nolans-tenet-trailer-reveals-an-awesome-practical-stunt\">massive set pieces</a>, <em>Tenet</em> will be Christopher Nolan\u2019s most ambitious endeavor to date. Though it\u2019s great to hear that the actors were kept in the loop at all times, which probably aided their performances. Now, we just need to hope that audiences don\u2019t get lost and that our <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495434/tenet-big-questions-we-still-have-about-christopher-nolan-movie\">biggest questions</a> are answered. But for now, let\u2019s just focus on the biggest question we have about the project \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495917/christopher-nolan-still-pushing-for-new-movie-tenet-to-open-theaters-but-its-not-his-choice\">its release date</a>. <em>Tenet</em> is still set to open in theaters on July 17.

    "title": "5 Marvel Characters Margot Robbie Would Be Perfect To Play",
    "content": "If there is one thing most of us can agree on in regards to the movies involved in the DC Extended Universe, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/margot%20robbie\">Margot Robbie</a> practically <em>IS</em> Harley Quinn. The infectious energy, impassioned devotion, and unmistakable Brooklynite accent that she brings to the role in both <em>Suicide Squad</em> and <em>Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey</em> is the kind of comic book movie portrayal that we only get to see every so often. It even posits the thought of what she could bring the table in the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/marvel\">Marvel</a> movies. Of course, given her popularity with the DC crowd, it is more than likely the case that the ship has sailed on the chance for the two-time Academy Award-nominated actress to breathe life into a Marvel character for a long awaited introduction into the MCU any time in the near future. However, in retrospect, if Laurence Fishburne can appear in <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> and then star in <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em> two years later and, on the flipside, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1555520/dc-and-marvel-10-times-an-actor-switched-sides\">Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje</a> can play a Dark Elf in <em>Thor: The Dark World</em> before playing <em>Suicide Squad</em>'s Killer Croc, why can\u2019t Margot Robbie do the same? In fact, I can already think of an unfathomable amount of characters from the Marvel comic book universe who have yet to see the light of the MCU and whom Margot Robbie would be the ideal casting choice to bring to the big screen (or small screen, even). Of course, for the purposes of remaining concise, I have narrowed this particular selection down to just five. Could any of these four superheroes and one usual villain be the character that gives the DC movie actress a chance to be the best of both worlds? As soon as she walked into frame as Naomi Lapaglia in Martin Scorsese's <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/Wolf-Wall-Street-6322.html\"><em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em></a>, it was clear that Margot Robbie was destined to become an icon of fashion with how easily she could perfect any look. Admittedly, fashion is not a characteristic as commonly associated with Dazzler, whose ability to create light out of sound <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474626/how-dark-phoenix-got-that-cool-x-men-comic-cameo-into-the-movie\">earned her a place among the X-Men</a> and a singing career, but her sense of fashion is undeniably iconic to the comic book world and one that the Australian actress could bring a modern flair to on the big screen flawlessly. Not to mention, <em>Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481425/how-harley-quinns-birds-of-prey-performance-nods-at-marilyn-monroe\">revealed Robbie's hidden talent for song</a>, which only makes this role of a mutant also <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/dazzler/4005-1498/\">known for her prolific singing career</a> all the more fitting. At first glance, it may seem out of place for Margot Robbie, who has a good six years on Tom Holland (who already looks far younger than he is), to play <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467287/felicity-jones-wants-to-play-her-amazing-spider-man-2-character-for-the-mcu\">Felicia Hardy</a>, who is known to have a bad case of the hots for Spider-Man. Nonetheless, the MCU is famously and, yet, often respectfully, loose with the rules and could redefine <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2490364/the-batmans-zoe-kravitz-explains-why-catwoman-role-is-a-little-scary\">Marvel's platinum blonde response to Catwoman</a> as, perhaps, an unlikely mentor or, better yet, a reluctant collaborator whom Peter Parker finds himself crushing on in an intriguing role reversal. Or, maybe it is time to give Black Cat, a hero with a past for burglary, her own movie and what better way to get audiences excited for that than Robbie as the lead? While Harley Quinn already had a healthy legion of fans prior to 2016's <em>Suicide Squad</em> thanks to an impressive introduction on <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> that led to several <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489930/harley-quinn-storylines-from-the-comics-wed-love-to-see-in-the-movies\">canon comic book appearances and her own series</a>, Margot Robbie's portrayal managed to help widen that margin with a certain charm that made the otherwise mentally disturbed villain extremely appealing. Perhaps she could bring that same kind of spark to the role of Emma Frost that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/January-Jones-Acknowledges-X-Men-First-Class-Production-Rushed-23151.html\">January Jones, arguably, could not in <em>X-Men: First Class</em></a>. Also known as the White Queen, the blonde Frost <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/m/new/Watch-8-Minutes-Of-X-Men-First-Class-And-See-Emma-Frost-In-Slutty-Lingerie-24925.html\">lives up to her name with some, literally, icy abilities</a> that she has been known to use both against, or, in some cases, even alongside, the X-Men. There is probably not a soul in the world who wants to see Margot Robbie's flawless appearance altered any <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493565/suicide-squad-director-david-ayer-explains-lingering-jokers-and-harley-quinn-question\">further than her Harley Quinn makeup already has</a>, but the unorthodox nature of the mere idea has intriguing enough to inspire the recommendation that she play a comic book characters no one seems to have suggested her to play thus far.

It was the type of spy thriller that begged for a sequel. But with director troubles, it was having a hard time getting off the ground. Now, as it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476397/ranking-all-the-star-trek-movies-including-star-trek-beyond\"><em>Star Trek: First Contact</em></a> had a part to play in helping save Mission: Impossible 2. Ronald D. Moore and former writing partner Brannon Braga, who wrote <em>First Contact</em>, got on Tom Cruise\u2019s radar when the movie became a huge success. Ronald D. Moore explained that they were then approached by Paramount to help <em>Mission: Impossible 2</em>. Here\u2019s what he said: With <em>Mission: Impossible\u2019s</em> success, Tom Cruise wanted to get started on a sequel right away. He approached then director Brian De Palma and asked him when they could do a sequel, and De Palm <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493366/tom-cruise-wanted-mission-impossible-sequels-director-thought-it-was-hollywood-corruption\">honestly wasn't too keen on</a> continuing the story of Ethan Hunt. Nevertheless, De Palma's curt response didn't belay an eager Tom Cruise. At the time, Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga were budding writers working on <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>. So for them, being asked to take on a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> project was the opportunity of a lifetime. During his chat with <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/how-star-trek-saved-mission-impossible-2-1295768\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Ronald D. Moore later added: While <em>Star Trek: First Contact</em> received <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/dvds/Star-Trek-First-Contact-Special-Collector-Edition-918.html\">rave reviews</a>, <em>Mission: Impossible 2</em> became one of the most maligned installments in the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise, with most critics and audience\u2019s panning it. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Mission-Impossible-2-63.html\">CinemaBlend</a> even gave it one and a half stars, saying: Still, the critical setback of <em>Mission: Impossible 2</em> didn\u2019t set the franchise back at all.

    "title": "Why Logan Director James Mangold Had No Problem Killing Off Wolverine",
    "content": "Superhero movies don't typically kill off their main heroes, as there are fears that viewers may not respond well to such a development. Audiences want to see their heroes overcomes their struggles and obstacles and stand victorious at the end, and studios want audiences to leave the theater feeling optimistic. However, <em>Logan</em> director <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2308541/logan-director-james-mangold-has-found-his-next-movie\">James Mangold</a> took a somewhat different approach. With <em>Logan,</em> James Mangold realized he had a chance to do something different within the superhero genre. Mangold came to the conclusion early on that there were only a few logical ways to end Hugh Jackman\u2019s run as Wolverine, with killing the adamantium-clawed mutant being one of the major choices. Here\u2019s what he had to say: Before retiring from the role, Hugh Jackman had famously played Wolverine for nearly 17 years, with his first appearance being in <em>X-Men</em> back in 2000. Ironically, Hugh Jackman <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1751449/hugh-jackman-heard-his-first-x-men-movie-was-going-to-bomb-before-it-came-out\">thought the first movie would bomb</a>, but instead became a sensation and helped launched several sequels and Wolverine-centric spin-offs, though some of those outings fared better than others critically. Hugh Jackman first announced in 2015 that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Hugh-Jackman-Walking-Away-From-Wolverine-71336.html\"><em>Logan</em> would be his final appearance</a> as the iconic X-Man. Clearly, giving Hugh Jackman\u2019s version of the hero a proper send-off weighed heavily on James Mangold\u2019s decision to kill off the character. While speaking with <a href=\"https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/logan-wolverine-dead-james-mangold-hugh-jackman-interview/\">ComicBook.com</a>, Mangold later added: Hugh Jackman seemed to echo James Mangold's sentiments, saying that he knew <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2461999/hugh-jackman-has-a-colorful-way-of-describing-his-wolverine-exit\">it was \u201ctime\u201d</a> to say goodbye. Still, Jackman has admitted that if the timing had been right, he would have been game to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494712/hugh-jackman-would-have-been-game-to-be-an-mcu-star-had-the-timeline-worked-out\">join the MCU</a> as Wolverine. Fans have long wished he could have joined the shared universe, but alas, it wasn\u2019t meant to be. While main superheroes historically haven't been killed off in films, <em>Logan</em> may have set a precedent. <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> and <em>Endgame</em> killed off a whole host of superheroes, including the main man himself, Iron Man. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477828/marvels-kevin-feige-wanted-tony-starks-death-in-endgame-to-be-just-as-impactful-as-logan\">Kevin Feige admitted</a> that he wanted Iron Man\u2019s death to have the same impact that Wolverine's had in <em>Logan</em>. Could this mean we might see more superhero movies breaking the chain and killing off major heroes? Not likely, as Wolverine and Iron Man\u2019s deaths were exceptions to a rule that's very hard to break. Instead, we should probably be asking ourselves who'll play Wolverine in the MCU now that he'll eventually be recast. It's hard to say who it'll be but, whoever it is, he'll have big shoes to fill.

    "title": "Joker 2: 8 Major Questions We Have About The Potential Joker Sequel",
    "content": "The Joker is one of the most wildly-popular comic book antagonists in pop culture history. Nevertheless, many folks were surprised by the astonishing commercial success of Todd Phillips' gritty re-imagining. The R-rated character drama grossed over a billion dollars worldwide and secured 11 Oscar nominations \u2014 ultimately taking home two trophies, one of which went to Joaquin Phoenix's mesmerizing performance. After earning a great deal of notice and a decent bit of controversy to boot, <em>Joker</em> became an extraordinary hit \u2014 even <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481767/13-quick-joker-reviews-from-different-cinemablend-staff-members?pv=search\">despite divisive reviews</a>. Therefore, it was only a matter of time before the inevitable sequel talk came into play. While Phoenix and Phillips envisioned their movie as a standalone story, that hasn't stopped sequels from happening before. Indeed, there's reported interest from Warner Bros. to make a follow-up, but that also raises some queries. Here are eight serious questions we have about <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/joker-2\"><em>Joker 2</em>.</a> Admittedly, if we do get <em>Joker 2,</em> it'll take a while. Beyond the fact that all movie productions are <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2492950/updated-list-of-major-tv-show-delays-or-ending-early-due-to-coronavirus\">suspended in the midst of a global pandemic,</a> the sequel is still not officially greenlit. It's not clear yet if the movie is happening. While there were <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485205/joker-sequel-happening-joaquin-phoenix-likely-to-return\">initial reports</a> that claimed <em>Joker 2</em> was on the way, they were <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485264/wait-the-joker-todd-phillips-sequel-news-may-not-be-a-thing-after-all\">apparently exaggerated</a>. But Phillips admits that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2486365/todd-phillips-discusses-joker-sequel-rumors-following-golden-globe-nominations\">he discussed the idea</a> with WB and considered it a possibility. If that's the case, we might be getting a follow-up, but it'll be a hot minute before it's released. It could be another five or more years, at least, and that's only if all the parties involved agree to pursue it. Nevertheless, it's not <em>impossible.</em> But if it happens, it won't be overnight. While Todd Phillips was initially reluctant to make a sequel to <em>Joker,</em> he has since softened his tone and he's sounded <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/01/hero-nation-joker-todd-phillips-wild-card-and-the-future-of-dc-films-warner-bros-batman-geoff-boucher-1202823194/\">more open</a> to the prospect. Reports suggested that Phillips met with Warner Bros. with the possibility of making a <em>Joker</em> sequel or producing other standalone DC movies under DC Black's label. But that doesn't guarantee Phillips will jump on-board the potential sequel, let alone write or direct. If <em>Joker 2</em> is officially greenlit, it'll likely be after Phillips agrees to sign the dotted line. WB is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496488/did-zack-snyder-just-tease-a-return-to-dc-to-finish-his-justice-league-story-arc\">traditionally a filmmaker-first studio</a>, and they'll probably want Phillips in their corner before they push this into production. But it's possible that if <em>Joker 2</em> does come to be, Phillips might only assume a producer role. Phillips' involvement is no guarantee at this point. With so few details currently in place for this speculated sequel, nothing is certain. While <em>Joker 2</em> is the placeholder title that's thrown around, it's highly possible that this continuation will adopt a different title altogether \u2014 especially if the focus is not what people assume. Indeed, there's a chance this potential sequel might not be a direct sequel at all. Rather, it could be the next installment in a cinematic anthology series, following a new DC character \u2014 or <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493290/joker-actors-who-could-follow-in-the-footsteps-of-heath-ledger-and-joaquin-phoenix\">another version of this DC character</a> \u2014 from at least some of the same filmmakers. Indeed, if this style worked out for shows like FX's <em>American Horror Story</em> or <em>Fargo</em>, which take place in the same stylized universe but follow different characters and different timelines, this format could easily be transitioned onto the silver screen. Indeed, this idea could allow Todd Phillips and his team to respect the standalone conceit of his original concept while also expanding upon his vision of a dark, more mature Gotham by focusing on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481747/6-dc-comics-villains-that-deserve-a-joker-like-movie\">other memorable or frightening characters.</a> It'll be a challenge to recreate this same success, but it could be a possibility if Phillips doesn't want to taint his Oscar-winning movie with a sequel that might jeopardize what people found so refreshing about his 2019 movie. It could provide another bold, striking take in the same vein as <em>Joker</em> for another DC character. Perhaps someone like Lex Luther, who Joaquin Phoenix was <a href=\"https://collider.com/joaquin-phoenix-batman-superman-lex-luthor/\">once rumored to play</a>. This liberating wiggle room could allow for more creativity, and it could make Phillips feel less constricted by the limitations of a franchise and more willing to make more standalone, non-franchise driven movies under DC's new branch of moodier, R-rated movies. By the end of <em>Joker,</em> Arthur Fleck fully adopted his Clown Prince of Crime persona. He's wearing the make-up. He embraced his laugh. Arthur is gone now; The Joker is running wild. By that extension, Arthur has completely accepted the villainous lifestyle, opting to indulge in his dark tendencies and fantasies, showcasing little-to-no remorse, empathy, or pity for others in his trail of destruction. By any reasonable measure, Fleck is now a villainous character \u2014 if certainly a troubled one given a tragic backstory. With that in mind, will The Joker remain the primary villain in this sequel, or will we be introduced to an antagonist even more wicked and destructive than our central character? With a villain as our lead character, it's certainly hard to say. With the exception of our title character and the Wayne family, most of the characters seen throughout <em>Joker</em> were either invented for the movie or weren't major DC characters. The focus of <em>Joker</em> is intently on our memorable villain, portraying this famous comic book character in a grittier, more grounded way. But with the possibility of a sequel on the horizon, and the movie's outstanding box office success (notably compared to its humble budget), <em>Joker 2</em> could introduce other DC characters \u2014 possibly other villains \u2014 into the fold, particularly with more money to play with. The possibility of seeing, say, goofier Batman bad guys like The Riddler and The Penguin are unlikely, but we might be introduced to another version of Harley Quinn, for instance, or maybe Todd Phillips' interpretations of Harvey Dent and/or Catwoman. It's not out-of-the-question. Notably with Arthur Fleck seen in an asylum at the end of <em>Joker</em>, even though he's trying to escape, it's possible we'll be introduced to a few other nutty DC characters confined under the same roof as The Joker. The avenue is clearly there. Whether or not the filmmakers take it is left unclear. We don't spend a lot of time with Bruce Wayne in <em>Joker.</em> There's a good reason why. The future vigilante is merely a boy here, living in his mansion while his father is a successful businessman with aspirations of becoming the Mayor of Gotham. There is one memorable scene where Arthur Fleck interacts with the future Batman in front of a locked gate, and there's (obviously) the scene where our young Bruce watches his doomed parents be slain before him. Otherwise, Bruce Wayne factors in very rarely in <em>Joker.</em> His presence feels mostly like studio pressure. \"How can you have a Joker movie without Batman?,\" you can hear them saying. But will that change with <em>Joker 2</em>? Will Batman remain a side character during the next chapter of Fleck's story, or will we see him become The Dark Knight? Without a proper idea of when <em>Joker 2</em> takes place following the original's finale, it's hard to know how old Bruce Wayne will be during the events of this proposed sequel. He might still be a kid. He could be a teenager. Or he could be a young adult, on the cusp of assuming his alternate identity. It's unknown if this sequel will play with the timeline. The studio might push for a younger Batman, for instance. Or we might see Bruce Wayne and Arthur Fleck duke it out even before Bruce becomes the Caped Crusader \u2014 further cementing their arch rivalry. We might not necessarily get a full-out brawl between these two comic book characters, but we might see what further inspires their ongoing strife \u2014 possibly leading up to a more climatic, action-friendly trilogy capper. But we're jumping ahead a bit. As we've noted by now, Todd Phillips' <em>Joker</em> wasn't envisioned to be a franchise starter. Unlike several other tentpole comic book-based blockbusters nowadays, DC-related or otherwise, this Oscar-winning character study was meant to be a smaller, singular story. It wasn't meant to connect to any cinematic universes. There weren't any plans conceived from the onset of making it a continued narrative. But if the idea of a sequel is being proposed, the cards shift a bit. If this sequel is meant to elongate the narrative and expand its story, will it also serve as a standalone sequel, or is it expected to put the pieces in place for a third (possibly final) movie, thus building a trilogy? Certainly, based on its billion-dollar success, WB probably wants a trilogy. But is that narratively feasible? As suggested before, the problem here is that The Joker is far from your typical protagonist. The movie was an examination into what turns an unsettled man into a psychopath. It's a filmmaker's interpretation of the origin story of one of our most notorious villains. By expanding these origins into a potential second or third movie, the filmmakers are at high risk of losing what made <em>Joker</em> effective to so many viewers and what compelled our lead actor to make the movie in the first place \u2014 not to mention the potential danger of making The Joker someone the audience is expected to root for. It's a tricky balance, building on the narrative while also recognizing why he's such a terrifying menace, but it's not impossible. But it'll prove to be an interesting challenge for all members involved, and it'll be intriguing to see what their sequel intentions will be. Also worth noting: Joaquin Phoenix has never made a sequel. As we alluded to earlier, we don't know when <em>Joker 2</em> might take place. We don't know if it'll immediately follow the events of the original, or if there will be a sizable time-jump. Also, we don't know what Gotham looks like now. We'll presumably be seeing the city in the midst of criminal anarchy; Gotham is rotten with crime sprees and Batman hasn't assumed his identity yet. There were riots on the streets, people putting on clown masks, and a desire to take down authority figures and the rich. Murray Franklin was murdered on-air. Thomas Wayne and his wife were killed in cold blood. The Joker has inspired city-wide havoc. Or did he? There's reason to believe the final few scenes \u2014 possibly the whole second half \u2014 didn't happen. There is an argument to be made that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481483/joker-ending-explained-what-really-happened\">the ending of <em>Joker</em></a> was all <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481724/what-joaquin-phoenix-really-loved-about-the-joker-ending\">a figment of Arthur Fleck's warped imagination</a> \u2014 the delusions of a psychotic man without his medication or therapy who cracks himself up. He was already <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489099/joker-hidden-details-from-the-joker-that-fans-caught\">prone to fantasies</a> throughout <em>Joker.</em> He might've been in his apartment or the hospital this whole time, believing himself to be elsewhere, causing havoc on Gotham. Certainly, that might explain why everything happened in such rapid-fire succession in the second half. But this <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/90eigo/was_holden_caulfield_actually_in_a_mental/\"><em>Catcher in the Rye</em></a>-esque fan theory only works if the movie itself is, indeed, a solo movie. If a sequel is made, this theory would need be addressed \u2014 or it would automatically cancel it out. One wonders, then, if this proposed sequel will bring up this idea at all, or if the filmmakers will bypass it to tell whatever story they wish to tell. Do you think <em>Joker 2</em> will actually happen? What questions do you have about this proposed sequel? Let us know in the comment section. Will is an entertainment writer based in Pittsburgh, PA.

    "title": "Halloween\u2019s Director Has Finally Cleared Up One Of The Film\u2019s Biggest Mysteries",
    "content": "One of the coolest things about <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1704129/halloween-2018\"><em>Halloween</em>\u2019s 2018 revival</a> was the way it brought Jamie Lee Curtis\u2019 Laurie Strode back into the fold. By picking up with her years after she first battled Michael Myers, there was a <em>lot</em> that fans missed in her life -- and the movie didn\u2019t fill in all the details. Thanks to a quarantine-induced livestream, though, <em>Halloween</em>\u2019s director has cleared up one huge mystery about <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2459849/what-happened-to-halloweens-laurie-strode-after-michael-myers-first-attack-according-to-jamie-lee-curtis\">Laurie\u2019s past</a>. The team behind the newest <em>Halloween</em> film made a brilliant choice in retconning <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2434859/what-went-wrong-with-halloween-h20-according-to-jamie-lee-curtis\">the rest</a> of the franchise\u2019s installments and creating a direct sequel to the 1978 classic. By refocusing on the original film\u2019s protagonist, it brought some of the quintessential magic of that film back. It also meant fans were introduced to the sad reality of the adult Laurie Strode. At the beginning of <em>Halloween</em>, she isn\u2019t doing well -- still dealing with PTSD from her original encounter with Michael Myers, she\u2019s drinking heavily, living alone and hiding from the rest of the world. She\u2019s been so destructive that she had her daughter Karen, played by Judy Greer, removed from her custody when she was a preteen. Now her only regular connection to the outside world is her granddaughter Allyson. David Gordon Green and the rest of the <em>Halloween</em> team did a great job of catching us up to speed with Laurie\u2019s life so we could understand what was at stake when she finally emerged to fight off Michael Myers one more time. However, there were a few not-so-small pieces of her backstory that the filmmakers didn\u2019t get a chance to offer up. Like, for instance, the identity of Karen\u2019s father. Luckily, the director was able to finally give fans an answer during a recent <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496370/jamie-lee-curtis-says-shooting-one-halloween-scene-was-one-of-the-most-moving-moments-of-her-career\"><em>Halloween</em> live-streaming event</a>. The film\u2019s cast and crew joined fans to watch the film and tweet out responses under the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/HalloweenAtHome?src=hash\">#HalloweenAtHome</a> hashtag and offer up behind-the-scenes tidbits, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464194/halloween-director-david-gordon-green-waited-a-decade-to-film-one-kill\">David Gordon Green</a> manned Blumhouse Productions\u2019 Twitter account to offer up his own anecdotes. When one fan asked Judy Greer and Jamie Lee Curtis about Karen\u2019s dad, he interjected: Okay, so maybe that\u2019s a little anticlimactic. It makes sense why that detail wasn\u2019t included in the final cut, though - it\u2019s kind-of hard to squeeze a story about a drunken one-night stand in the middle of a bloodbath. By excluding the backstory, David Gordon Green also reinforced the fact that <em>Halloween</em> is really Laurie\u2019s story -- what matters most isn\u2019t how she became a mom, but that she rises to the occasion when her family needs her the most. It\u2019s probably safe to assume we won\u2019t ever really hear about Karen\u2019s dad in future <em>Halloween</em> installments. We <em>can</em> expect to see more of Laurie and the family members that matter to her in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496505/halloween-kills-director-teases-serious-violence-in-the-upcoming-sequel-jamie-lee-curtis\"><em>Halloween Kills</em></a>, which is currently scheduled to hit theaters on October 16, 2020.

This led everyone from <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2483683/yes-jason-momoa-has-seen-the-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-and-its-very-different\">cast members</a> to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493440/zack-snyders-latest-snyder-cut-image-takes-fans-deep-inside-a-mysterious-location\">the director</a> himself to reveal enticing tidbits about what that version of the film would even look like. Still, given how quickly Zack Snyder had to exit the project, it\u2019s always been unclear as to whether he even has enough footage to truly finish the film. Now, it looks like we have an answer: While these comment's from <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/how-the-releasethesnydercut-movement-succeeded-when-nobody-thought-it-would-podcast/\">TheWrap's</a> Umberto Gonzalez may be a bit of a letdown -- even for the cast, who were <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546673/how-jason-momoa-ben-affleck-and-other-justice-league-stars-responded-to-the-snyder-cut-becoming-a-reality\">totally geeked</a> about the Snyder Cut news -- it\u2019s understandable -- reassembling the cast would be a logistical challenge, especially given the current uncertainty surrounding when regular film production can begin. Having the budget to polish up existing footage should still result in a version of the film that\u2019s more satisfying. Fans have also been curious as to whether or not a successful Snyder Cut could lead to a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546729/could-the-snyder-cut-lead-to-justice-league-2-and-more\">revival of the <em>Justice League</em> franchise</a>. Yet it looks like that\u2019s probably not in the cards, either: We\u2019ve waited so long for the Snyder Cut, that it\u2019s good to know what we\u2019re in for when it finally arrives. If we have reasonable expectations about the finished product, that means when we finally get to see the Snyder Cut, we\u2019ll be able to fully enjoy it by focusing on what\u2019s <em>in</em> it, rather than what may have been left out or what could have been. Though there\u2019s no official release date, thanks to the official announcement on Twitter, we know that HBO Max plans to premiere the film in 2021.

    "title": "Titanic: How Historically Accurate Was The 1997 Movie Starring Leonardo DiCaprio",
    "content": "There's a good chance that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470824/20-iconic-90s-movies-that-bring-on-the-nostalgia\">you've seen</a> James Cameron's monumental <em>Titanic</em>. The 1997 blockbuster starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1730920/the-wooden-staircase-in-titanic-was-almost-a-total-disaster\">wasn't a sure bet</a> when it went through its enormous, hectic production. Nevertheless, Cameron proved his critics wrong by producing a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479554/every-james-cameron-movie-ranked\">widely acclaimed</a>, multi-award-winning and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477203/the-10-movies-that-sold-the-most-tickets-avatar-and-avengers-endgame-dont-make-the-cut\">extremely lucrative movie</a> that continues to stand as one of the crowning filmmaking achievements of the '90s. The movie is highly praised for its incredible mix of practical and CG effects, its rousing emotional tenders and its singing romance at the center, but how much is it celebrated for its accuracy? James Cameron went to painstaking lengths to make it extremely accurate to real life. Did those efforts pay off? Let's find out. It should be noted right off the bat that, ultimately, only so much is known about what exactly happened that night. Since most of the ship's crew and passengers unfortunately sunk to their demise on that cold, devastating night, there are only a few confirmed details about what exactly happened. Meaning it was going to be difficult for the movie adaptation to convey accuracy regarding what it felt like to be on that terrible sea voyage. There are a lot of theories and an endless stream of speculation to be made about the trip, but we'll try to stick to the fact whenever we can in here. But this should be noted at the top. It should also be noted early that Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) weren't, in fact, actual passengers on the Titanic. Instead, they were characters created by James Cameron to connect us to the real-life story, in order to get a passionate, emotional connection to this historical account. There was no steamy love affair between them, nor was there the love triangle involving Billy Zane's vindictive supporting character. It was a fabrication to give us something that will let us know what it was like to be on this ship and to suffer its grave consequences. While the main characters in <em>Titanic</em> were concocted by the filmmaker, James Cameron's attention to accuracy can definitely be seen in some of the prominent supporting characters, many of whom follow what we know about these perished people's shortened lives. For instance, Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber), i.e. the Chief Designer for the Titanic, is seen in the First Class smoking room staring at a painting of the Titanic on the wall. By many accounts, this is accurate to how he died on the ship. Similarly, Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) did help people board lifeboats, worked to keep them calm and tried to get the lifeboats to retrieve as many passengers as possible as the historic ship kept plunging deeper into the dark recesses of the sea. There is also a scene in <em>Titanic</em> where an elderly couple hold each other's hands on their beds and cry while their room fills with water. This is based on a real-life couple, Isidor Straus (i.e. the owner of Macy's) and Ida Straus, who, according to reports, refused special treatment. His wife did not want to leave him, so they went to their room together, which was their final resting place. It's a touching, quietly humane detail that James Cameron rightfully thought would add emotional tenderness to his gigantic cinematic experience. While we're primarily focused on the tale of Jack and Rose as the ship sinks into the bottom of the sea, Cameron's added touches in these moving moments help bring a fine sense of authenticity. While James Cameron strived to tell a realistic account, there are some details that appear to be based more on theories pertaining to the Titanic than anything that can be confirmed as accurate and/or official. For instance, there's a noteworthy sequence where many of the third-class passengers are barricaded against their will below the deck, preventing them from reaching the lifeboats and upper deck, in a stark bit of socioeconomic commentary. However, there's very little evidence to support this claim \u2014 at least, according to historian Richard Howells (as reported by <a href=\"https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/canada/articles/the-historical-accuracy-of-james-camerons-titanic-unsinkable/\">The Culture Trip</a>). Howells claims that these gates seen in the blockbuster weren't meant for shipwreck necessarily, but rather the prevention of diseases from spreading above. Additionally, while there were class tensions, it was highly exaggerated when James Cameron depicts a scene where passengers are shot and killed while trying not to lose their luggage during the ship's sinking. Additionally, when it came to depicting the truth or picking something more emotionally impactful, James Cameron opted for something that plucked at the viewer's heartstrings rather than stayed true to how events had actually unfolded. One of the most famous scenes in <em>Titanic</em> is when the band decides to play \"Nearer, My God, To Thee\" as the musicians see their final moments before sinking into the depths of the unforgiving sea. It's a sweet, tender moment that depicts a beauty amid chaos, hoping to find something that captures a sense of calm around the calamity. It's a lovely scene; alas, it's not fully accurate. It's actually copied from 1958's <em>A Night to Remember.</em> In the moment, there is a similar moment when the band members decide to play one final heartfelt tune, to hopefully allow themselves and their doomed passengers to find some sort of peace before the end is due. According to one survivor on the ship, though, this isn't entirely true to what actually happened in real-life. Instead, the band reportedly played popular ragtime music, but it obviously wouldn't capture the same emotional tone. While James Cameron consulted with historical experts throughout the writing, pre-production and filming process, he opted for a creative touch here. This is something that has recently been contested, notably with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/3D-Or-3D-Buy-Right-Titanic-Ticket-30270.html\">the movie's 3D re-release back in 2012</a>. In <em>Titanic</em>, the ship splits in half, which is true to what happened to the boat. Then, the bow of the ship starts to sink, while the sterns bobs from about a 90-degree angle before it plunges right into the dark icy cold water below. This sequence famously sees Jack and Rose holding the railing for their dear lives as the ship sinks further into the sea. While this is mostly true to what is believed to have happened, it's not entirely accurate. By James Cameron's own admission, there was quite likely a moment where this piece of the ship was standing \"quite proud\" on the water, but it wouldn't be quite as dramatic or suspenseful as it was inside the movie. Ultimately, in this scene, while James Cameron mostly relied on the truth, he opted for a choice that was more emotionally fulfilling than true. There are other examples to be addressed, but we don't want to get all <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1711209/the-real-problem-with-titanics-ending-according-to-neil-degrasse-tyson\">Neil deGrasse Tyson here</a> and be sticklers for the truth. Suffice to say that when it comes to the realism and accuracy of <em>Titanic</em>, a large part of it is mostly true. Outside of the fabricated romance, the movie does actually capture a lot of real details and subtle touches which should be admired. But there are also some big choices made that don't exactly hold water when scrutinized. Will is an entertainment writer based in Pittsburgh, PA.

    "title": "The Walking Dead: What These Former Cast Members Are Doing Now",
    "content": "Since its debut on Halloween night in 2010, AMC's <em>The Walking Dead</em> has gone from an intimate adaptation of the Robert Kirkman's long-running comic book series to a massive cultural phenomenon thanks in part to the the rich storylines and the expansive cast that almost outnumbers the army of zombies that populate the show's landscape. And over the course of the show's first 10 seasons, many members of the cast like <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/andrew-lincoln\">Andrew Lincoln</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/Danai-Gurira\">Danai Gurira</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/jon-bernthal\">Jon Bernthal</a> have become gone from relatively unknown actors to massive stars. But with a cast as large as the one on <em>The Walking Dead</em> there are bound to be a few that leave the show either because their characters' stories are finished or they want to move onto something else and further their careers. And even though we'll be seeing the return of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2492625/how-amc-the-walking-dead-tv-show-will-end-according-to-chandler-riggs\">Lauren Cohan's Maggie when Season 11 premieres</a>, what about some of the other former members of the cast who left the series. What are they up to? Andrew Lincoln served as the anchor of the larger <em>The Walking Dead</em> cast with his portrayal of Rick Grimes for the show's first nine seasons, but the English actor and aggressive zip-up sweater wearing hopeless romantic in <em>Love Actually</em> had been planning on leaving the show <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2458886/why-andrew-lincoln-didnt-leave-the-walking-dead-in-season-8-as-hed-planned\">as early as Season 8</a> but stayed on for one more season before leaving <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2481906/the-walking-dead-why-each-of-the-major-cast-members-left\">to spend more time with his family</a>. Since leaving the AMC series, Lincoln has kept a relatively low profile, but he is set to appear in the upcoming drama <em>Penguin Bloom</em> where he will star alongside Naomi Watts. And despite no longer being on the show, Lincoln recently gave former co-star Danai Gurira <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2493263/watch-the-walking-deads-andrew-lincoln-say-farewell-to-danai-gurira-with-a-song\">a touching sendoff following her final episode</a>. Speaking of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, we're still waiting for more news on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2487868/the-walking-deads-rick-grimes-movie-will-heighten-the-stakes\">those spinoff movies featuring the return of Rick Grimes</a>. It seems like it was just yesterday that Danai Gurira announced that she would be stepping away from her role of Michonne after Season 10 of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, explaining that she <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2476829/the-walking-dead-danai-gurira-tearfully-confirms-her-exit-as-michonne\">was being called</a> to other things in her life during a panel at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con. Even before and since her departure, Gurira has remained quite busy balancing time as a hero in the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477170/of-course-danai-guriras-okoye-is-returning-for-black-panther-2\">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> as well as a hero in the real world as a <a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2018/12/press-release-un-women-announces-danai-gurira-as-goodwill-ambassador\">UN Women Goodwill Ambassador</a>, which she was named in December 2018. On top of that, the former <em>The Walking Dead</em> star is busy at work writing the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/hbo-max\">HBO Max</a> series <em>Americanah</em>, as well as <em>Godzilla Vs. Kong</em>, which is slated to come out in the November 2020. Jon Bernthal is one of those quietly amazing actors, and that was no different in his portrayal of Shane Walsh, Rick Grimes' former best friend-turned-enemy in the first two seasons of <em>The Walking Dead</em>. The role was <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2481906/the-walking-dead-why-each-of-the-major-cast-members-left\">suspected to be short-lived from the jump</a>, but there are times when you can't help but miss the gravity Shane brought to many of the situations early on in the series. Since leaving the series, Bernthal has become one of the most prolific actors of our time with bit roles in a number of instant-classics as well as Frank Castle on the Netflix Marvel series <em>Daredevil</em> and <em>Punisher</em>. And with several upcoming projects including the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2491857/the-punishers-jon-bernthal-is-getting-his-sexy-on-for-next-big-tv-role\">TV adaptation of <em>American Gigolo</em></a> and <em>The Many Saints Of Newark</em> (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2445129/the-sopranos-prequel-movie-took-a-big-step-forward\">the long-awaited prequel film to <em>The Sopranos</em></a>), it looks like we'll be seeing more of Bernthal for years to come. For three seasons on <em>The Walking Dead</em>, Sarah Wayne Callies portrayed Lori Grimes, but the character's fate when she sacrificed herself to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2467462/the-walking-deads-lori-carl-and-judith-had-a-beautiful-grimes-family-reunion\">give birth to Judith during a Cesarean section</a> that ultimately took her life. During an interview with <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/walking-dead-season-3-sarah-wayne-callies-lori-rick-spoilers-352635\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Callies stated that the character had to die in order to push Rick Grimes to the next level. After leaving the show, Callies went on to return to the Fox series <em>Prison Break</em> as well as the TNT drama <em>Colony</em>. The actress is currently on the NBC series <em>The Council Of Dads</em>, a series Callies told <a href=\"https://siouxcityjournal.com/entertainment/television/sarah-wayne-callies-considered-quitting-acting-then-found-council-of-dads/article_d7ab5685-60bf-5f00-8d8f-20ca94ab61f3.html\">The Sioux City Journal</a> stopped her from quitting acting altogether. Laurie Holden was quite vocal about the death of her character Andrea in the Season 3 finale of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, the culmination of a storyline with the Governor <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1709560/one-former-walking-dead-star-went-off-calling-characters-death-nonsense\">the actress was not too fond of</a> following her departure. Since leaving the show, Holden has remained quite busy both with her acting career (which most recently included television work on <em>Proven Innocent</em> and animated feature <em>Arctic Dogs</em>) and her work in charity and human rights work, including the <a href=\"http://www.somaly.org/\">Somaly Mam Foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://ourrescue.org/\">Operation Underground Railroad</a>, and Home From Home. Jeffrey DeMunn was one of the members of the original Atlanta crew in the first two seasons of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, but the actor <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2393652/the-walking-dead-star-who-actually-requested-to-be-killed-off\">asked to be killed off</a> after Frank Darabont, the original showrunner, was pushed out of the production. DeMunn and Darabont have worked together multiple times over the years starting with the 1994 release of <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, so it should come as no surprise that the actor would leave in that fashion. Since leaving the show, DeMunn has remained busy in film and television, including the Showtime series <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/billions\"><em>Billions</em></a>, where he currently plays Chuck Rhoades, Sr. There is no death on <em>The Walking Dead</em> more shocking and unsettling than the brutal murder of Steven Yeun's Glenn by the hands of the evil Negan. Like many of the characters in the series, their deaths were predetermined in the pages of the original comic series, and that's the case for Glenn, though Robert Kirkman shared with <a href=\"https://ew.com/article/2016/10/28/walking-dead-glenn-steven-yeun-robert-kirkman/\">Entertainment Weekly</a> that there were talks of keeping him around. Those talks never panned out, but Yeun has stayed busy with projects like <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495685/the-lighthouse-and-other-really-weird-movies-available-to-stream\"><em>Sorry To Bother You</em></a>, <em>Burning</em>, and the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/a24\">A24</a> feature <em>The Humans</em>, where the actor will star alongside Jayne Houdyshell, Richard Jenkins, Beanie Feldstein, Amy Schumer, and June Squibb. Michael Rooker only appeared in 14 episodes of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, but his performance as Daryl Dixon's older and antagonistic brother Merle is one worth remembering. There was no saving Merle after he turned into a zombie at the end of Season 3, but the death of his character hasn't stopped Rooker from continuing his career in film and television. After leaving the series, Rooker became an even bigger star following <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495533/sylvestor-stallone-says-that-gotgs-michael-rooker-is-a-madman-on-movie-sets\">his portrayal of Yondu</a> in <em>Guardians Of The Galaxy</em> and <em>Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2</em>., where he reunited with James Gunn. The partnership, which started with <em>Slither</em>, will continue when Rooker appears in Gunn's 2021 <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478261/james-gunn-keeps-teasing-king-shark-but-wholl-play-him-in-the-suicide-squad\"><em>The Suicide Squad</em></a>. And expect to see the actor enter the <em>Fast And Furious</em> franchise with the 2012 release of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478329/fast-and-furious-9-just-added-a-guardian-of-the-galaxy-star\"><em>F9</em></a>. One of the biggest shocks of Season 8 of <em>The Walking Dead</em> was the early departure of Chandler Riggs as Carl Grimes from the series when Rick's son was bitten by a walker, ending his run in the process. Fans and stars of the show <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2284851/why-the-walking-deads-norman-reedus-wasnt-happy-about-carls-big-shocker\">were equally as shocked</a> by former showrunner Scott Gimple's choice of killing off one of the central characters, but no one took it as bad as Riggs' father who had some choice words for Gimple <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1739089/chandler-riggs-dad-just-called-out-the-walking-deads-showrunner-over-what-happened\">after his son was written off the show</a>. In 2019, the former <em>The Walking Dead</em> star was cast as Patrick \"PJ\" Nelson on the ABC drama, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2480476/how-a-million-little-things-jumped-the-gun-on-romance-ahead-of-season\"><em>A Million Little Things</em></a>, which was renewed in March 2020. Sonequa Martin-Green originally <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/the-walking-dead-how-sonequa-martin-green-cast-sasha-2017-8\">auditioned for the role</a> of Michonne in <em>The Walking Dead</em>. Though the part ended up going to Danai Gurira, Martin-Green snagged the part of Sasha. She recurred on the series in Season 3 and was bumped up to a series regular in The Walking Dead's fourth season. Like many of her other former cast-members, Martin-Green's character had a very <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1642719/how-the-walking-dead-changed-that-huge-death-from-the-comics\">memorable exit</a>. After her departure from <em>The Walking Dead</em>, Martin-Green took a starring role in the CBS All Access series, <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em>. She's also <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/sonequa-martin-green-lebron-james-space-jam-2-1203174107/\">expected to appear</a> in <em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em> in 2021. Before the introduction of Negan, there was no character more dastardly or deadly than <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/david-morrissey\">David Morrissey</a>'s portrayal of Philip \"The Governor\" Blake\" starting in Season 3 of <em>The Walking Dead</em>. Like many of the characters featured in both the comic and television series, The Governor suffered a violent death during the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1193269/Walking-Dead-Villain-Promoted-Series-Regular-Season-4\">Season 4 midseason finale</a>. Since leaving <em>The Walking Dead</em>, Morrissey has gone on to have roles in <em>Inside No. 9</em>, the Amazon series <em>Good Omens</em>, and the upcoming <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dampyr-movie-wade-briggs-harlan-david-morrissey-gorka-comic-romania-1203389201/\"><em>Dampyr</em> adaptation</a>. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2393821/will-fear-the-walking-dead-reference-morgans-family-heres-what-lennie-james-says\">Morgan Jones</a>, portrayed by the great Lennie James, was one of the first characters Rick Grimes meets in Season 1 of <em>The Walking Dead</em>, and the character showed up several more times over subsequent seasons before becoming a member of the main cast starting in Season 6. And despite dying in Season 8, Morgan had the rare distinction of showing up in the spinoff series <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495396/fear-the-walking-deads-lennie-james-gets-cryptic-about-morgans-fate-and-now-im-worried\"><em>Fear The Walking Dead</em></a>, where James remains as a series regular. In addition to <em>The Walking Dead</em> universe, James has shown up in films like <em>Blade Runner 2049</em> and the upcoming <em>Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway</em>. Those are just a few of former <em>The Walking Dead</em> stars that have gone on to continue their careers in film, television, and elsewhere in recent years. I'm sure whenever the show returns, we can expect to see more characters and actors on this list. If you want to know which former castmember hasn't watched the AMC series, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2545579/one-walking-dead-vet-has-never-watched-the-show-but-thinks-its-message-is-still-relevant\">you can check that out here</a> on CinemaBlend. Philip grew up in Louisiana (not New Orleans) before moving to St. Louis after graduating from Louisiana State University-Shreveport. When he's not writing about movies or television, Philip can be found being chased by his three kids, telling his dogs to stop yelling at the mailman, or yelling about professional wrestling to his wife. If the stars properly align, he will talk about For Love Of The Game being the best baseball movie of all time. Subscribe To The Walking Dead: What These Former Cast Members Are Doing Now Updates",

    "title": "The Jurassic Park Moment That Made Sam Neill Feel Really Famous",
    "content": "From any angle, Sam Neill has had a tremendous career. Ninety-nine percent of other actors would swap out their IMDB with his in a second, but despite regularly working for decades and fronting one of the most well-liked and successful blockbusters of all-time, he\u2019s not one of those stars that\u2019s too famous to go about his daily life. He doesn\u2019t regard himself as a celebrity and rarely feels like it, at least when he\u2019s not a Comic-Con. Sam Neill recently talked to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/23/sam-neill-i-should-be-at-pinewood-the-jurassic-world-iii-sets-are-there-waiting\">The Observer</a> about his life, plans to shoot <em>Jurassic Park</em> being interrupted and how he views his success. During the chat, the actor admitted he doesn\u2019t typically feel his fame but said he does have one really vivid memory with a large group of fans. Here\u2019s a portion of his quote\u2026 As someone who has been to Comic-Con plenty of times in the past (unfortunately <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494665/san-diego-comic-con-officially-cancels-2020-event\">not this year</a>), I can attest to what a weird experience it can be, even as an observer. It\u2019s almost like a sporting event. Normally in life, most of us have some degree of restraint because we don\u2019t want to be visibly way more excited than everyone else. At Comic-Con, however, everyone else is usually freaking out, which allows everyone else to turn off their own filters. So, the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476757/watch-tom-cruise-surprise-top-gun-fans-at-san-diego-comic-con\">noise</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp0w1kxloZ0\">excitement</a> often just builds and builds. It\u2019s unreal and not surprising Sam Neill has such vivid memories. Of course, what we all want Sam Neill to be doing right now is shooting <em>Jurassic World III</em>. The acclaimed actor was <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496481/has-sam-neill-filmed-anything-for-jurassic-world-3-yet-heres-what-the-jurassic-park-actor-says\">supposed to be</a> doing that this month, but the worldwide mess we\u2019re all dealing with has gotten in the way of that, which obviously sucks for all of us, even if it would have forced Neill to be awake a little earlier. Fortunately, whenever <em>Jurassic World</em> is ready, fans will be eagerly waiting. The popular franchise has carved out its own path, with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466722/laura-dern-and-sam-neill-look-totally-different-now-in-this-jurassic-park-reunion-photo\">some tie-ins</a> to the original films, but the next installment, <em>Dominion</em>, looks like it\u2019s going to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482815/jurassic-world-3-an-updated-cast-list-for-dominion\">bring everything together</a> once and for all (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546777/wait-jurassic-world-3-wont-be-the-end-of-the-jurassic-park-franchise-after-all\">or maybe not?</a>). That\u2019s incredibly exciting for fans of the franchise, and if the world is able to get back to normal, it will hopefully produce at least one more gathering to remind Sam Neill of how many fans he has and how appreciative we all are of the incredible work he\u2019s put in over the years, including in non-<em>Jurassic Park</em> projects like <em>The Piano</em>, <em>Peaky Blinders</em> and my personal favorite, <em>The Tudors</em>.

    "content": "Rumor has it we\u2019re getting <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/the-new-mutants-69487.html?pv=related_list\">a <em>New Mutants</em> movie</a> later this year. I know, I know\u2026 stop laughing. The anticipated X-Men spinoff film literally has been years in the making, and while Fox and Disney has <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478888/x-mens-the-new-mutants-a-history-of-the-delays-so-far-and-when-the-film-will-hit-theaters?pv=related_list\">delayed the film numerous times</a> for various reasons, <em>New Mutants</em> currently has <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496162/the-new-mutants-has-a-new-release-date-and-its-soon?pv=related_list\">a scheduled release date</a> of August 28. Need another reason to get fired up for the oft-delayed movie? Dig this: OK, so, maybe you are asking, \u201cWho is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sinKEVitch/status/1264744502507343872\">Bill Sienkiewicz</a>, and why should I care?\u201d New Mutants fanatics absolutely recognize him, as his groundbreaking art helped to elevate the mutant team\u2019s comic books in the 1980s, during their early run. His roughed-up and unusual style made <em>The New Mutants</em> comic book covers stand out on the spinner rack. And now he has confirmed that he has contributed to the movie\u2019s opening credits, which is flat-out fantastic. Here\u2019s one example of Bill Sienkiewicz\u2019s gorgeous <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495799/the-new-mutants-image-offers-first-look-at-a-characters-mutant-powers?pv=related_list\">New Mutants animation</a>, to give you an idea of what he could bring to the movie\u2019s opening credits sequence: In a way, this makes a lot of sense. The story that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492894/why-the-new-mutants-director-felt-less-pressure-after-dark-phoenix-flopped?pv=related_list\">Josh Boone\u2019s <em>New Mutants</em> movie</a> will be based on involves a threat known as the Demon Bear. In the comics, this was a mystical creature that plagued Dani Moonstar (Blu Hunt), a mutant whose power involves making people see their worst fears, materialized. Danielle believes that the Demon Bear killed her immediate family, and she leans on the New Mutants to help her bring the monster to justice. And the art in the New Mutants books was attributed to Bill Sienkiewicz. In fact, he joined the title with the Demon Bear story in August 1984, so having him appear in the movie \u2013 even just in the opening credits \u2013 is a fitting tribute. That\u2019s not to say that the <em>New Mutants</em> movie will be a direct adaptation of the Demon Bear storyline. Josh Boone has also talked in interviews about how the horror sequel <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors</em> will influence his approach to this movie, with <em>New Mutants</em> almost <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492531/the-new-mutants-maisie-williams-explains-the-movies-same-sex-romance?pv=related_list\">coming across as the first pure-horror superhero movie</a> (with all due respect to <em>Blade</em>). This is why the trailer shows off the members of the New Mutants in a psychiatric ward. It\u2019s a different route into the familiar story. Will we ever see it? Who the hell knows. Honestly. We\u2019ve had a release date for Josh Boone\u2019s <em>New Mutants</em> on multiple occasions, and they have come and gone, with the movie getting delayed over and over. Movie theaters should be open long before August 28, with plenty of other films playing before <em>New Mutants</em>. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2491686/the-new-mutants-director-reveals-how-the-delays-actually-helped-the-movie?pv=related_list\">So it\u2019s looking good</a>.

    "content": "It\u2019s a wild time to be involved in a fanbase. Supporters of filmmakers like Zack Snyder or David Ayer are <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546756/suicide-squad-and-6-other-movies-that-deserve-the-snyder-cut-treatment?pv=related_list\">seeing incredible progress</a> in their campaigns to get unreleased versions of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/videos/zack-snyders-justice-league-official-release-how-we-got-here-why-its-so-important/2546652/?pv=related_list\">movies like <em>Justice League</em></a> and <em>Suicide Squad</em> released. And people like Snyder and Ayer are lending their support to the online efforts, blurring the line between filmmaker and fan when it comes to restoring artistic integrity, usually in the name of a good cause. A similar campaign has sprung up around <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2490249/alita-2-7-things-to-keep-in-mind-as-we-wait-for-sequel-news?pv=search\">Robert Rodriguez\u2019s <em>Alita: Battle Angel</em></a> in recent years, with fans clamoring for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2491715/alita-battle-angel-actor-thinks-there-should-be-more-than-one-sequel?pv=search\">a sequel</a> to the movie (which ended on a significant cliffhanger). The movie\u2019s star, Rosa Salazar, and its producer, Jon Landau, have encouraged the fan base to make noise so that Disney hears them. And their latest campaign has a component to raise awareness, while also benefitting an important charity. Inspired by a recent Instagram post by Jon Landau, the Alita Army is <a href=\"https://alitaarmy.org/2020/05/21/the-alitasequel-us-billboard-campaign/\">raising funds</a> to pay for a digital billboard that they will purchase on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. Their goal will be to run an ad for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494109/alita-battle-angel-2-the-obstacle-christoph-waltz-thinks-is-in-the-way-of-a-sequel?pv=search\">an <em>Alita: Battle Angel</em> sequel</a> 30 times per hour. They raised $1,617 in six hours to complete the transaction, and this will allow the billboard to run from June 1 to June 7. Here was <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAVPLFhJsvl/\">the Landau post</a> that triggered the billboard campaign. However, the Alita Army is taking a page out of the Release the Snyder cut playbook. In addition to raising funds to pay for the Los Angeles billboard that would call for the <em>Alita</em> sequel, the group also has called attention to an Amazon Wish List promoted by Rosa Salazar that allows patrons to purchase essential items for homeless people. Salazar says that she has bene getting DMs asking how fans can pitch in after they saw her making donations to homeless in her community. This inspired <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485830/alita-battle-angel-producer-reveals-how-fans-can-help-make-alita-2-happen?pv=search\">the Alita Army</a> to get involved, and you can read all about their efforts <a href=\"https://alitaarmy.org/2020/05/15/rosa-salazars-charity-work-during-covid-19-pandemic/\">on this page</a>. Normally, I\u2019d never really know how any of this might shake out. We never dreamed that Zack Snyder\u2019s <em>Justice League</em> would get released, and now it\u2019s coming to HBO Max. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2488155/buckle-up-alita-battle-angel-fans-are-raising-money-to-campaign-at-the-oscars?pv=search\">Robert Rodriguez\u2019s <em>Alita: Battle Angel</em></a> made $404 million worldwide, and movies that made less have received sequels. So anything is possible, even though Fox (which backed <em>Alita</em>) is now owned by Disney, and a sequel to <em>Alita</em> likely would be pretty expensive. But so long as there\u2019s hope, the Alita Army will fight\u2026 and do a little good for the world in the process. Movie junkie. Infatuated with comic-book films. ReelBlend cohost. Resident dad.

    "content": "Netflix has been in the Adam Sandler business for years now, and business steadily has boomed. We may never know the full statistics for the viewing habits of Sandler\u2019s faithful, but <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2546807/cancelled-netflix-favorite-is-getting-resurrected-on-cable-channel?pv=related_list\">Netflix</a> has claimed that films like <em>Murder Mystery</em>, <em>The Do-Over</em> and <em>The Week Of</em> have found their audiences. Sandler\u2019s brand is so strong, Netflix now takes gambles on Adam\u2019s boys, as when David Spade gets to carry <em>The Wrong Missy</em> on the streaming platform. The movie has been a modest hit for Netflix (trending in certain places and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496587/david-spade-thanks-fans-after-new-netflix-film-the-wrong-missy-hits-1?pv=search\">generating buzz</a> for a previously unheard of comedy). In the film, Spade plays a guy who invites his dream girl, Missy, on a corporate retreat. Only, he mistakenly texts the wrong Missy, and ends up in paradise with the crazy Lauren Lapkus. In a recent interview with <a href=\"https://www.comingsoon.net/movies/features/1134747-cs-interview-nick-swardson-on-the-wrong-missy\">ComingSoon</a>, <em>The Wrong Missy</em> co-star Nick Swardson (another Sandler barnacle) opened up about a completely improvised scene, and how he helped build it. Commenting on his \u201cdrunk\u201d scene, Swardson explained: Usually, that\u2019s funnier, too. In <em>The Wrong Missy</em>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496435/why-netflixs-the-wrong-missy-was-tricky-for-david-spade-to-film?pv=search\">David Spade and Nick Swardson</a> are corporate guys on a retreat, and yes, that usually IS when buttoned-up suits let their hair down and get a little wild. In the same interview, Swardson went on to say that they improvised because <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546799/why-adam-sandlers-movies-are-so-great-to-work-on-according-to-the-wrong-missy-star?pv=search\">their producer, Adam Sandler, wasn\u2019t present</a>, but also because they know the type of humor that he wants to see in his types of comedies. From that perspective, Nick Swardson\u2019s right. He has been studying in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489368/every-adam-sandler-movie-on-netflix-ranked?pv=search\">the school of Adam Sandler</a> for years, appearing in <em>Sandy Wexler</em>, <em>The Ridiculous 6</em>, the <em>Grown Up</em> films, and more. David Spade clearly trusts him, and it\u2019s fun to learn the behind-the-scenes stories on these comedies. <em>The Wrong Missy</em> is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495194/adam-sandler-movies-available-streaming-right-now?pv=search\">available to stream</a> right now.

    "title": "With The Snyder Cut Coming, DC Fans Are Destroying Their Copies Of Justice League",
    "content": "DC film fans have been in a tough spot these past three years. None of them liked the theatrical cut of <em>Justice League</em> (I mean, how could you?). And yet, as completists, they probably still invested in their own copy so that it could rest on the shelf next to her DVD or Blu-ray copies of <em>Man of Steel</em>, <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em>, <em>Wonder Woman</em> and more. However, now that they know Zack Snyder finally will be able to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546806/jason-blum-has-fascinating-opinions-about-the-snyder-cut-getting-released?pv=related_list\">complete his vision</a> with a <em>Justice League</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546790/looks-like-zack-snyders-justice-league-cut-wont-involve-reshoots-with-the-original-cast?pv=related_list\">coming to HBO Max</a>, fans are taking their current copies of <em>Justice League</em> and literally setting them on fire. Drastic. Yet, understandable. For many, they don\u2019t even want to remember that Joss Whedon\u2019s version of Justice League \u2013 known, by DCEU fans, as \u201cJosstice League\u201d \u2013 existed on any level. So they took out their frustrations by destroying the copy of the DVD that, truthfully, they never should have purchased in the first place. No matches handy? Grab a hammer, like this dude: And if that seems like too much work, simply <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546748/ben-affleck-responds-to-the-snyder-cut-announcement-thanks-fans-for-their-support?pv=related_list\">take your DVD</a> out of its sleeve and\u2026 throw it into your backyard?

Personally, I\u2019m holding on to my copy of Josstice League. It\u2019s a reminder of how horribly things went, and it stands as a monument for the people who refused to accept that film, then turned around and fought, passionately, for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546729/could-the-snyder-cut-lead-to-justice-league-2-and-more?pv=related_list\">the release of the Snyder Cut</a> of <em>Justice League</em>.

We\u2019re currently unsure if the restored cut is going to be four hours, or six episodes of a longer series. Not making a physical copy seems like money left on the table, because you KNOW that once <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546673/how-jason-momoa-ben-affleck-and-other-justice-league-stars-responded-to-the-snyder-cut-becoming-a-reality?pv=related_list\">Snyder makes his version available</a>, his fans will want to own it.

    "content": "Odds are that fans were going to be talking about the final part of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/videos/the-skywalker-saga-in-under-15-minutes/2487065/?pv=search\">Skywalker Saga</a> for decades regardless of what was actually in it, but the situation we ended up with has left <em>Star Wars</em> fans in a very unique position. It isn't simply that <em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em> made a series of choices that not everybody loved, it's that, thanks to a leaked draft of a script, we have another, very different take, on how that story could have gone. And it would have led to a very different path, although the same ultimate end, for one <em>Star Wars</em> bad guy, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2487483/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalkers-domhnall-gleeson-reveals-deleted-scene-for-hux?pv=search\">Domhnall Gleeson</a>'s General Hux. In <em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em>, we learn that General Hux has become a spy for the Resistance inside the First Order. He doesn't sympathize with their cause, but instead he simply wants to see Kylo Ren fail so badly that he goes to extreme measures. In the end, however, he is discovered, and shot down with zero fanfare by <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465590/richard-e-grant-calls-star-wars-security-extraordinary?pv=search\">Richard E. Grant</a>'s Allegiant General Pryde. Director <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2486169/what-if-colin-trevorrow-had-directed-star-wars-episode-ix?pv=search\">Colin Trevorrow</a>'s script for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489238/star-wars-the-one-way-duel-of-the-fates-should-make-its-way-to-the-masses?pv=search\"><em>Star Wars: Duel of the Fates</em></a>, would have ultimately seen General Hux die on screen as well, but in the version of the script that leaked online, it's revealed (via <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/colin-trevorrow-star-wars-9-script-general-hux/\">ScreenRant</a>) that his method of death would have been self inflicted. In that version, Hux is no traitor. Instead, he finds himself realizing that defeat is inevitable, and so he goes to his room, to a display case which holds a variety of objects, including at least one vintage lightsaber, and he uses it to impale himself. Notably, the lightsaber he uses has a purple blade. The <em>Star Wars</em> movies were in large part inspired by classic samurai films, and so the decision to see Hux perform a version of seppuku is perhaps quite fitting. It also, if nothing else, gives Hux a more noble send off, far more so than the one that he got. The scene also reveals some interesting details about Hux. While he clearly hated Kylo Ren, the fact that Hux collected objects belonging to those that used the Force shows that the General may have simply been jealous of those able to use the Force. The choice of weapon to use is also of note. There has only been one wielder of a purple lightsaber in the <em>Star Wars</em> films so far, Samuel L. Jackson's <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475035/samuel-l-jackson-still-really-wants-to-play-star-wars-mace-windu-again?pv=search\">Mace Windu</a>. While the script doesn't appear to state specifically that it is <em>that</em> lightsaber being used, the connection is almost certainly meant to be made by the audience. And of course, that lightsaber went out a window decades before with its owner. It's certainly possible it was picked up and has been bought and sold by collectors since then. There are a lot of people who wish we had gotten to see Colin Trevorrow's <em>Star Wars Episode IX</em>. We'll never know what it really would have looked like. The final draft that we're aware of pre-dated the death of Carrie Fisher, and thus even if Trevorrow had remained the director, his movie would have gone through some changes before it hit the screen. In the end, the stories of the galaxy far, far away are meant to by mythic anyway, so this can simply be one version of how the story could have gone.

    "title": "Suicide Squad Director Reveals Epic Deleted Scene For Katana",
    "content": "It's a fascinating time in the DC Extended Universe. There's a handful of highly anticipated movies coming down the pipeline, and it <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546631/suicide-squad-director-posts-cryptic-joker-message-after-snyder-cut-is-announced\">was recently announced</a> that the mythical Snyder Cut of <em>Justice League</em> was finally becoming a reality courtesy of HBO Max. This victory has some fans already calling for the Ayer Cut of <em>Suicide Squad</em>, as his ill-fated movie also suffered from studio interference. And now David Ayer has revealed one epic deleted scene for Karen Fukuhara's Katana. Katana was a relatively small part of <em>Suicide Squad</em>, although she kicked some serious ass throughout the movie's runtime. Plenty of David Ayer's ideas for the villain-centric movie <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495817/suicide-squad-director-confirms-fan-theory-about-jared-letos-joker\">fell by the wayside</a> on its journey to theaters, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496501/wait-suicide-squad-almost-gave-harley-quinn-a-love-triangle\">including a love triangle</a> between Harley, Joker, and Will Smith's Deathstroke. And Katana was originally given an epic sequence of her own. As Ayer shared on social media, Yeah, that sounds awesome. It would have been awesome to see Katana doing battle with the members of the <em>Suicide Squad</em>, especially after the group bonded over drinks earlier in the film. Harley Quinn and the crew likely wouldn't want to hurt her, although her soul-stealing sword would really raise the stakes. Talk about FOMO. David Ayer's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidAyerMovies/status/1264718924819558400\">tweet</a> is sure to add more fuel to the fire for moviegoers hoping to #ReleaseTheAyerCut. A ton of scenes and concepts were ultimately cut from <em>Suicide Squad</em>, something that the filmmaker <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494298/why-suicide-squad-director-david-ayer-says-harley-quinns-story-arc-was-eviscerated\">has been open</a> about throughout the years-- especially after the theatrical cut failed to resonate with critics and audiences alike. And the filmmaker's original plans for the movie sound even more ambitious. Katana was a mostly silent member of Task Force X in <em>Suicide Squad</em>. While she fought along the team throughout the movie's runtime, she had a limited amount of dialogue and character development. But it would have been epic to see Cara Delevigne's Enchantress possess the sword master, and attempt to her strengths against the likes of Captain Boomerang, El Diablo, and Deathstroke. But that scene was cut, and Katana never really got her chance to shine in the movie's theatrical cut. Task Force X's <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495249/james-gunns-suicide-squad-research-was-even-more-intense-than-we-realized\">story will continue</a> with James Gunn's <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, which is a sequel/reboot involving another team of DC villains. While there are a ton of new faces making up the all-star cast, there are a few actors returning from David Ayer's original movie. Unfortunately, there's been no indication of Karen Fukuhara returning to play Katana agin. Although we will see Harley Quinn, Rick Flag, Amanda Waller, and Captain Boomerang appear in Gunn's DC debut. With the Snyder Cut arriving in 2021 after years of fan campaigning, it should be interesting to see how David Ayer's bits of information on his version of <em>Suicide Squad</em> help to fuel the new calls for the #AyerCut. The DC fandom is no doubt feeling galvanized by the <em>Justice League</em>'s alternate cut becoming a reality, although David Ayer himself has explained that his cut probably <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546801/suicide-squad-director-explains-why-the-ayer-cut-probably-wont-happen\">won't see the light of day</a>. There are a ton of DC projects to look forward to including <em>The Batman</em>, <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, and <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em>-- in addition to the upcoming re-release of <em>Justice League</em>. It'll be interesting to see how the DCEU continues to change with each new movie, as Warner Bros. appears to be planning the shared universe's future based on each movie's performance at the box office. The next installment in the DCEU is <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> on August 14th.

    "title": "Star Wars Fans Pitch Solo 2 And Explain Why It Needs To Happen",
    "content": "May 25th is an important date for Star Wars fans. It was on that date in 1977 that the original <em>Star Wars</em> movie was released. However, <em>Star Wars</em> fans, or at least some of them, are not spending May 25 celebrating the 43rd anniversary of <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>. Instead, they're focused on today being the second anniversary of another movie in the franchise, <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>. <em>Solo</em> wasn't a smash hit when it arrived in theaters two years ago, but it's clear that the movie has fans, as they're still hoping that sequel to <em>Solo</em> could still happen. Last year the fans got Make Solo 2 Happen <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2472228/ron-howard-responds-to-solo-sequel-campaigns?pv=search\">trending on Twitter</a>, and this year they're all back at it again, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23MakeSolo2Happen&amp;src=trend_click\">flooding Twitter</a> with calls to make the sequel that was clearly expected to happen when the first movie was made. There are some passionate fans out there who aren't letting this one go. <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> has the dubious distinction of being the only <em>Star Wars</em> movie of the Disney era not to make $1 billion at the global box office. Having said that, it was still a top 10 movie of the year at the domestic box office in 2018 and it grossed just short of $400 million worldwide. It's a number that could have resulted in a host of sequels if it was any other movie. However, due to some behind the scenes turmoil that resulted in the original directors <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2395952/ron-howard-clarifies-status-of-solo-a-star-wars-story?pv=search\">getting replaced</a>, which in turn led to a significant amount of reshoots and a longer than expected filming schedule, <em>Solo</em> was almost certainly a much more expensive movie to make, making the comparatively smaller box office take hurt the movie that much more. While the expectation initially was that we would be getting a whole series of <em>Star Wars Story</em> spinoff films, <em>Solo</em>'s lack of success apparently killed that plan. It doesn't feel like there's a great deal of mourning for the spinoffs or <em>Solo</em> in general, but today it's equally clear that there are certainly people who love this movie and want to see more. And <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> certainly left some stories to be told. The move ended with Qi'ra as the new head of a criminal enterprise, the ultimate head of which was revealed in the film's finale to be <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495021/solo-a-star-wars-story-originally-used-darth-maul-much-differently?pv=search\">Maul</a>. Anybody who hadn't kept up on the animated <em>Star Wars</em> series would have been shocked that Maul was even still alive at this point, and even those that knew he was were excited by the possibilities of such a reveal. At this point, it seems highly unlikely that the <em>Solo 2</em> fans will actually get the movie they want. Of, course, some don't actually need a theatrical follow-up. They would be happy with a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493658/solo-2-unlikely-to-happen-at-disney-according-to-the-writer?pv=search\">Disney+ series</a> that didn't even necessarily include Han Solo, but instead focused on the criminal organization being run by Qi'ra. Of course, if there was one aspect of <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> that was met with a great deal of support, it was <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2458292/the-crazy-ways-people-treated-donald-glover-after-he-was-cast-as-lando?pv=search\">Donald Glover</a>'s performance as a young Lando Calrissian, and so, for those people, more Lando is really all they want. And honestly, can you blame them? And who knows, following the news that one group of fans has successfully helped a project we never thought we'd see reach the light of day, perhaps the <em>Solo 2</em> crowd will be energized to build up their own movement.

However, representation has been an important part of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2484070/Why-Pixars-SparkShorts-Series-Might-Not-Be-What-Disney-Fans-Expect?pv=search\">Pixar's Sparkshorts series</a> on Disney+, and the newest entry, titled simply, <em>Out</em>, marks the first time that a gay character has been the lead in any story we've seen from Disney. <em>Out</em>'s main character is named Greg, and the 8-minute short follows him as he's getting ready to move from a small town to the big city. It's made very clear up front the Greg is gay, we meet his boyfriend Manuel, but Greg isn't open about his sexuality, and when his parents surprise him by showing up to help him pack, Greg ushers Manuel out the back door. Greg isn't sure what to do, as having his parents help him pack runs the risk of them discovering his truth on their own. He briefly wishes he had the simple worry-free life of his dog Jim, and then, thanks to a bit of magic, the two switch places. As a dog, Greg now has to both protect his secret from his parents while also keeping his dog, in his body, from doing anything too crazy. Of course, as the dog, Greg also has a chance to see his parents from a new perspective, and he understands them a little bit better. It's a touching little story that also has some laugh out loud moments, and even a fun little <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474609/toy-story-4-contains-an-easter-egg-from-every-single-pixar-movie?pv=search\">Pixar easter egg</a> in the form of a minor <em>Toy Story</em> character who appears as Jim's favorite toy. It's basically everything we've come to love out of Pixar's feature films in a smaller package. Pixar's Sparkshorts series are unique creations of the studio. A number of different individuals inside the studio get tapped to make a short, and they do so with a small team, a small budget, and little to no oversight from the studio. They get to make exactly the story they want to make. The results have seen stories about women working in male dominated workplaces, the difficulties of raising children with special needs, and even a short where the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2488641/disney-why-pixars-first-non-verbal-character-was-a-completely-new-experience-for-animators-in-loop?pv=search\">main character is an autistic woman</a>, and voiced not by a professional voice actor, but somebody actually dealing with autism. In the past, Disney has been both praised and criticized for decisions regarding homosexual representation. We've seen some forward progress in the form of \"<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1630630/how-beauty-and-the-beast-will-introduce-disneys-first-gay-character-on-the-big-screen?pv=search\">gay moments</a>\" and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2455580/the-jungle-cruise-will-reportedly-feature-disneys-first-openly-gay-character?pv=search\">gay characters</a>, but there has also been <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456386/disney-is-facing-backlash-over-gay-jungle-cruise-character?pv=search\">some backlash</a> for the way these things have been handled. <em>Out</em> may not change the landscape all by itself when it comes to representation, but it's an important step nonetheless. And it's also just a great animated short, and something new to enjoy from Pixar while we're waiting for the now delayed release of <em>Soul</em>. <em>Out</em> can be <a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/out/2XVmI60xhOK8\">seen on Disney+</a> now.

    "title": "George Lucas Almost Sold Star Wars Before Empire Strikes Back, Here's Why He Didn't",
    "content": "The first <em>Star Wars</em> movie may have been a huge hit, but that doesn\u2019t mean the path forward was super clear after its theatrical run concluded. Creator George Lucas had a decision to make. He could push forward with the property mostly on his own and retain full control and shoulder all the risk or he could turn <em>Star Wars</em> over to FOX and just take a percentage of the future grosses. He obviously gambled on himself, but apparently, he wrestled with the decision. George Lucas revealed his thought process during a longer piece with <a href=\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/star-wars-making-empire-strikes-back/\">Empire</a>. Here\u2019s his take on the matter\u2026 Lucas ultimately bet on himself, and he bet on himself in a really big way. Rather than let a studio finance the sequel itself, in this case FOX, he instead took out a $15 million loan and only worked in FOX for distribution, at least initially. Unfortunately, not everything goes to plan when you\u2019re in Hollywood. <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> went way over budget. The original $15M ballooned into $25M, which later ballooned into $33M. The banks got so nervous Lucas had to bring in FOX to help secure the loan. It\u2019s unclear what he had to give up in exchange for their help, but once the film was finished and released, there was no concern about paying anyone back. Empire Strikes Back made some <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546776/why-george-lucas-kept-darth-vaders-empire-strikes-back-twist-from-the-actor\">bold</a> creative <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546808/why-george-lucas-had-doubts-about-introducing-yoda-in-star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back\">choices</a> and grossed more than $300M during its initial run, which was an absolutely gigantic figure in 1980 (still is too!). Its success allowed George Lucas to make <em>Return Of The Jedi</em> and of course, continue to make more <em>Star Wars</em> movies <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495836/star-wars-dave-filoni-loves-the-phantom-menace-lightsaber-fight-but-not-for-the-reason-you-think\">down the road</a>. He eventually got the itch to sell <em>Star Wars</em> and LucasFilm to Disney but that wasn\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Disney-Acquires-Rights-Lucasfilm-Developing-Star-Wars-Episode-VII-2015-33834.html\">until 2012</a>. Disney paid handsomely to the tune of more than $4B in combined cash and stock in a deal that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2460444/disney-has-already-made-its-money-back-after-buying-lucasfilm\">worked out well</a> for both parties. That\u2019s a pretty good return on investment from that original $15M loan. There are very few entertainment-related things on the Internet people like to argue about more than George Lucas and the decisions he made when it came to <em>Star Wars</em>, but regardless of how you feel, it\u2019s worth remembering and taking into account how much he risked to bet on himself and bet on the future of <em>Star Wars</em>. He had a clear idea of the story he wanted to tell, and he gambled to retain that creative control (at least for a long time). Not a really high percentage of filmmakers would do that. Many would take the security, even if it left final say of their franchise in someone else\u2019s hands. Then again, it's also worth keeping in mind that fans have been just as vocal and found as many reasons to complain about <em>Star Wars</em> after Disney assumed control and started <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485760/what-if-george-lucas-ideas-had-been-used-for-the-star-wars-sequel-trilogy\">using its own ideas</a>. I'm sure Lucas doesn't miss that part at least. Enthusiastic about Clue, case-of-the-week mysteries, the NBA and cookies at Disney World. Less enthusiastic about the pricing structure of cable, loud noises and Tuesdays. Subscribe To George Lucas Almost Sold Star Wars Before Empire Strikes Back, Here's Why He Didn't Updates",

    "content": "<em>CinemaBlend participates in affiliate programs with various companies. We may earn a commission when you click on or make purchases via links.</em> The entertainment industry has come to a halt due to global health concerns, resulting in a ton of changes that should be felt over the next few years. After theaters closed, a number of highly anticipated blockbuster were delayed, including Disney's live-action <em>Mulan</em> movie. Niki Caro's blockbuster was pushed back a number of months, with an intended theatrical release of July 24th. But now it looks like we may also know when <em>Mulan</em> will eventually be available to stream on Disney+. The House of Mouse has been making moves over on Disney+, producing original content and also being a home for all things Disney. Obviously <em>Mulan</em> was expected to eventually arrive on the streaming service sometime after its run in theaters, although now we may have an idea as to when that might happen-- and its all thanks to social media. One Twitter user recently asked when <em>Mulan</em> was heading to Disney+, to which the verified help account responded: Well, that seems pretty cut and dry. At least it did, because the tweet revealing <em>Mulan</em>'s possible Disney+ date as October 27th has since been deleted. So should we expect this live-action remake to be available to stream just a few months after <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496038/looks-like-disney-is-committed-to-mulans-current-release-date-following-some-parks-opening\">its new release date</a>? The tweet in question came from the official <a href=\"https://twitter.com/disneyplushelp?lang=en\">Twitter of Disney+ help</a>, before it was promptly deleted from the account. The streaming service just announced a ton of original content that'll be available for subscribers, leading for some fans to ask for specific projects on social media. That's exactly what happened in this case, with someone who was controlling the Disney+ help account revealing the possible <em>Mulan</em> Disney+ release date. But since the tweet has also been deleted, the House of Mouse may have other plans. Disney fans can watch the original <em>Mulan</em> on Disney+. You can <a href=\"http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/410947/705874/9358\">use this link for a free 7-day trial</a> to the streaming service. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492545/mulan-director-pens-letter-to-fans-after-disney-movies-delay\">Niki Caro's live-action adaptation</a> of <em>Mulan</em> was originally set to hit theaters on March 27th, before theaters were shut down and people all over the world stopped congregating in large groups. The new version will be void of musical numbers and delightful animated characters like Mushu, and instead focusing much more on the action and epic battle sequences. <em>Mulan</em> was <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2491673/disneys-mulan-remake-has-screened-see-what-people-are-saying\">getting solid buzz</a> before its release date was pulled, which is likely why fans are so eager for it to eventually arrive on Disney+. Now that Disney has its own streaming service, there's a home for each new blockbuster that arrives in theaters. After making appropriate <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2491446/how-much-mulan-may-make-for-its-opening-weekend\">money at the box office</a>, we've seen the likes of <em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> eventually become available on Disney+. <em>Mulan</em> is expected to follow suit, granted theaters open in time for its current release date. Over the past few years, Disney has made a habit out of producing live-action remakes of its animated blockbusters-- to great results. <em>Maleficent</em>, <em>Cinderella</em>, <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> have all done well in theaters, while CGI has brought new photo realistic versions of <em>The Jungle Book</em> and <em>The Lion King</em> to the masses. But <em>Mulan</em> looks like it's going to make liberal changes to the source material, so it should be interesting to see how moviegoers take to it. <em>Mulan</em> is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493868/disney-has-set-new-release-dates-for-black-widow-mulan-and-more\">currently expected</a> to hit theaters on July 24th.

    "content": "<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/netflix\">Netflix</a> has become the champion when it comes to the streaming wars. Though <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2489830/is-disney-as-good-as-netflix-heres-what-subscribers-think\">others are trying</a> to take its crown, Netflix is the most consistent with producing a variety of content that appeals to viewers of various backgrounds and entertainment preferences. It\u2019s also constantly producing series and movies that gain a lot of buzz during <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2485936/2020-netflix-schedule-premiere-dates-for-new-and-returning-shows\">its initial release</a>. One of Netflix\u2019s current hit series is <em>Sweet Magnolias.</em> <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> follows the three best friends Maddie (JoAnna Garcia), Dana Sue (Brooke Elliott), and Helen (Heather Headley) as they deal with life in the small-town Serenity. The series begins with Maddie stuck in the middle of a scandal as she just finalized her divorce from her ex-husband Bill (Chris Klein), who cheated on her with one of his nurses Noreen (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2546738/how-getting-pregnant-at-16-influenced-jamie-lynn-spears-sweet-magnolias-character-on-netflix\">Jamie Lynn Spears</a>). It\u2019s about Maddie, Dana Sue, and Helen figuring life out and trying to grow through the madness. <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> is a wholesome series that feels designed for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2487550/hallmarks-christmas-movies-won-big-in-cable-tv-ratings\">the Hallmark Channel crowd</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495457/first-trailer-for-lifetimes-lorena-bobbitt-movie-features-her-throwing-the-penis-out-of-the-car-window\">Lifetime movie aficionados</a>, which makes it perfect content for some feel-good, pick-me-up TV. If you\u2019ve already binge watched the entire first season, because of course you did, here\u2019s some other shows and movies to check out on Netflix. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2494805/gilmore-girls-careers-that-took-off-after-the-drama-series-aired\"><em>Gilmore Girls</em> follows</a> mother and daughter duo Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) as they deal with typical growing pains (e.g. love, work, kooky co-workers and friends, etc.). What usually gets this dynamic pair through it all is each other. <em>Gilmore Girls</em> is a show very much about the powerful bond between a mother and a daughter. <strong>Why It\u2019s a Good Option for Sweet Magnolias fans:</strong> <em>Gilmore Girls</em> and <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> share in their belief in the power of the family bond. Dana Sue and Maddie may not be perfect moms, but they definitely give everything to their children, for better or worse, and that\u2019s the same kind of energy Lorelai gives to Rory. <strong>Stream it on Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70155618\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Robert Redford and Jane Fonda play Louis and Addie, two widowers who have been next door neighbors for years. Addie finally decides to make a connection with him and the two start a platonic friendship to help them deal with their mutual loneliness, which grows into something deeper. <strong>Why it\u2019s a Good Option for Sweet Magnolias fans:</strong> <em>Our Souls at Night</em> has the same general sweet, simple small town vibe as <em>Sweet Magnolias.</em> It also deals with two people finding love after a major loss. Maddie starts to find love after the divorce with Cal (Justin Bruening), and Addie and Louis start to find love with each other after their spouses die. <em>Our Souls A Night</em> and <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> both show that love can happen even when you least expect it. <strong>Stream it on Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80104068\"><strong>here.</strong></a> This <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2307482/how-netflixs-new-queer-eye-cast-feels-about-the-original-and-being-the-new-fab-five\">reboot series follows</a> five gay men as they use their expertise to help transform everyday people into the best versions of themselves.

As Sam tries to find out the good samaritans identity, she finds love and learns the power of acts of kindness. <strong>Why it\u2019s a Good Option for Sweet Magnolias fans:</strong> <em>Good Sam</em> and <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> are stories of hope. For <em>Good Sam</em>, the hope comes in the generosity of strangers. In <em>Sweet Magnolias</em>, the hope is from the bonds of these three women, and also their love and belief in this town. <em>Good Sam</em> and <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> are also great content to watch with the family (though Sweet Magnolias does have at least one scene that may not be appropriate for younger audiences), and to give the local cynic a little bit less cynicism. <strong>Stream it on Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80998967\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Rachel Bilson plays Zoe Hart in this <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Hart-Dixie-Complete-First-Season-DVD-Review-47608.html\">former CW dramedy</a>. It follows New York doctor Zoe as she moves to Alabama.

Therefore, they rely partly on Southern charm, and the small town life narrative to tell their stories. The colorful townsfolk and town pride are important characters in both series. They also have a bit of a fish out of water storyline going on, with <em>Hart of Dixie,</em> Zoe is that character. With <em>Sweet Magnolias</em>, Helen is from Serenity, but she\u2019s also still an outsider because she left and tried to escape it before returning home. <strong>Stream it on Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70196150\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2455029/like-father-review\"><em>Like Father</em> stars</a> Kelsey Grammer and Kristen Bell as Rachel and Harry Hamilton, an estranged father and daughter pair. Rachel gets left at the altar, then binge drinks with her father, whom she hasn\u2019t seen in years, and they end up on her honeymoon cruise. They\u2019re stuck on a boat together, so all they can really do is try to repair their relationship. <strong>Why it\u2019s a Good Option for Sweet Magnolias fans:</strong> Even the best parents have complicated relationships with their children. We see Dana Sue and Maddie try their best to do things right for their children, but it\u2019s still not quite enough. We also see the opposite in Maddie and Dana Sue\u2019s ex-husbands. Who aren\u2019t exactly in the running for fathers of the year, though Bill at least tries in his own way. If you\u2019re in the mood for more child-parent drama after finishing <em>Sweet Magnolias</em>, then <em>Like Father</em> is a great choice. It\u2019s funny, while still being heartfelt and sincere. <strong>Stream it on Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80174897\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Anne Shirley rises in this reboot series based on the <em>Anne of Green Gable</em> book series. <em>Anne with an E</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2494967/how-anne-with-an-e-fans-giant-backlash-against-netflix-affected-canadian-tv-channel\">follows spirited Anne</a> (Amybeth McNulty) as she comes to live with unmarried brother and sister Marilla (Geraldine James) and Matthew (R.H Thomson) Cuthbert. Her dreamer sensibility and determination makes anyone who crosses her path fall in love with her. <strong>Why It\u2019s a Good Option for Sweet Magnolias fans:</strong> If strong female characters are your thing then you\u2019re in luck because Anne Shirley, Maddie, Dana Sue, and Helen are the kind of strong female characters that are kind, determined, and ready for a great adventure, in any way it might strike. <strong>Stream it on Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80136311\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> <em>When Calls the Heart</em> is a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2466755/hallmarks-when-calls-the-heart-is-getting-a-spinoff-and-more-coming-in-2019\">Hallmark original series</a> that follows a young teacher named Elizabeth Thatcher (Erin Krakow) as she leaves her high-society life in the early 1900s to work her first teaching job in a coal-mining town in Western Canada. She finds love and herself along the way. <strong>Why It\u2019s a Good Option for Sweet Magnolias fans:</strong> Love, adventure, growing up, and small-towns are both prominent aspects of <em>When Calls the Heart</em> and <em>Sweet Magnolias</em>. Each series gives their own special spin on the beauty that comes with the community small towns bring. It\u2019s a 'we\u2019re all in this together' kind of sentiment that radiates from both series. <strong>Stream it on Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80036407\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This Canadian drama follows a recently widowed father of three, John (William Baldwin), as he moves back to his rural hometown of Turtle Island Bay to give his family a new start.

She leaves her life in LA to escape her past and heal. <strong>Why it\u2019s a Good Option for Sweet Magnolias fans:</strong> Add a dash of small-town, painful past, nosey neighbors, city girl who doesn\u2019t quite fit in at first, but makes it work later, and then you have the premise of many shows and movies but this time it\u2019s the plot for <em>Virgin River.</em> Clearly, <em>Sweet Magnolias</em> shares many of those similar themes, including finding a new romance. <strong>Stream it on Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80240027\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The entire first season of <em>Sweet Magnolias</em>, and all these other series and movies, are streaming on Netflix.

    "content": "Praise the Firelord! <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/avatar-the-last-airbender\"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a> is finally back on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495114/when-avatar-the-last-airbender-will-be-streaming-again-on-netflix\">Netflix</a>. It\u2019s been a long time coming, but the greatest animated TV series of all time (we can debate this, but I\u2019m right) is available for all the people who have yet to watch it, and also for all the people who have already watched it a million and one times already. And while, yes, I do prefer <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2494722/sorry-avatar-the-last-airbender-but-the-legend-of-korra-is-a-better-series\"><em>The Legend of Korra</em></a> (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2504033/avatar-the-last-airbender-fans-reignited-legend-of-korra-backlash-but-netflix-wasnt-having-it\">Boo all you want</a>), I will never, ever, ever grow tired of watching <em>Avatar</em>. Everybody has their favorite episode, and how could they not? The show is so diverse and has such a deep lore that everybody is bound to prefer some episodes over others. But while one or two of your favorites might not be on this list, I guarantee that at least some of your favorites will definitely be on here. But enough of my yammering. Yip yip! Let\u2019s go! <strong>Oh, and minor spoilers ahead.</strong> Avatar always had a lot to say about a myriad of topics, and \u201cThe Painted Lady\u201d is their environmental episode. A spirit known as the Painted Lady watches over a fishing village. But when the Fire Nation comes along years later and builds a factory that pollutes the river, the spirit disappears. So Katara dons makeup just like the Painted Lady and gives the village hope. I just love Katara episodes, and this one is all about her. Her brother, Sokka, is all like, let\u2019s just keep going, because he thinks that if they defeat the Fire Nation, they can help this village in the long run. But Katara wants to help the villagers now, and she convinces the others to help her, too. I also just love the ending, which I won\u2019t spoil here. But I will say this\u2014a spirit never truly leaves. It just waits in the wings for someone new to discover it. Aang needs to learn firebending, fast! And Zuko would be a great teacher. Buuut, well, by this point of the story, Zuko\u2019s no longer angry, and anger always fueled his firebending. So Aang and Zuko travel to the Sun Warriors temple where they encounter the last two dragons in existence. The dragons are scary at first, but they show the true way of firebending, and both Aang and Zuko learn that fire doesn\u2019t necessarily need anger to fuel it. It just needs passion. This episode has my favorite moment in the entire series with the epic dragon dance. I also love how far Zuko has come as a character\u2014he\u2019s gone from hot head to chill dude. If the future <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2494593/5-things-netflixs-new-avatar-show-must-keep-from-the-animated-series\">live-action show</a> is just a recreation of the cartoon, then this episode has the potential to either be really lame, or extremely epic. It all just depends on the CG. Aang learns about the history of Avatar Roku. It turns out that the previous Avatar might be the reason why the 100 year war started in the first place. Avatar Roku was once friends with Fire Lord Sozin. When Roku grew older, he spared Sozin life\u2019s even though he turned out to be a real SOB. The story builds to a volcanic eruption, with Avatar Roku actually FIGHTING A VOLCANO. We also learn about the genocide of the Air nomads. All in all, a riveting episode. I love learning about the past avatars, and this episode goes so deep into the lore that it expanded the universe tenfold. Plus, I just have to say it again, but Avatar Roku <em>fights a volcano</em>. You don\u2019t get much more badass than that. Following the episode, \u201cThe Storm,\u201d Sokka is super sick and delirious, and Katara is taking care of him. But she gets sick, too! So Aang needs to get some herbs (or so he thinks), but winds up getting captured. He\u2019s broken out by somebody in a creepy blue mask, and when we learn who the person behind the mask is, it changes the whole series. I love how much this story travels, as even Momo has an objective. Plus, \u201cThe Storm\u201d and this episode really put the show on another level with its storytelling. Oh, and Aang airbends with his mouth! It\u2019s always cool to see new skills in times of duress. The Blue Spirit was also one of the only things that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Last-Airbender-4678.html\">the abysmal movie</a> actually got right, so this episode has that going for it, too. The final episode of the series, I won\u2019t reveal too much, but everybody has their moment. Toph and Sokka (and Suki!) with the airships, Katara an Zuko battling Azula, and of course Aang\u2019s epic battle with Fire Lord Ozai. As far as series finales go, this one lives up to the hype. A lot of people would probably pick the preceding episode over this one, but I really love how this episode closes everything out. Especially Aang in his Avatar state. It almost becomes a sort of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465826/how-dragon-ball-z-inspired-michael-b-jordans-creed-ii-performance\">Dragon Ball Z</a> fight between him and Ozai, which is utterly thrilling to watch. The conclusion to Book 1 is a fitting conclusion indeed. Admiral Zhao slays a very important figure, and waterbenders lose their abilities to bend. Aang gets pissed off because of this and goes into his Avatar state. He then wrecks the Fire Nation\u2019s ships and puts things back in order. Princess Yue also gives Sokka a kiss before sacrificing herself for the greater good. The Siege is a fantastic culmination of everything that takes place in Book 1. We also get a great deal of plot development when it comes to the spirits, which I\u2019m always a fan of. And unlike \u201cSozin\u2019s Comet: Part 4\u201d , Siege Part 2 is left on a satisfying cliffhanger that gets you pumped for Book 2. Zuko has been banished from the Fire Nation. He travels to the Earth Kingdom, which doesn\u2019t know that he\u2019s from the Fire Nation. He ends up staying with a family that takes him in and shows him kindness. Zuko helps the family against some soldiers, but doing so reveals his abilities, which gets him shunned. \u201cZuko Alone\u201d is one of those episodes that really elevates <em>Avatar</em> from just being a \u201ckid\u2019s show.\u201d We get a great deal of emotional depth from a flashback scene involving Zuko\u2019s mother, and we see the effects of war on a ground level. There\u2019s also a phenomenal episode on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495110/avatar-the-last-air-bender-and-the-legend-of-korra-every-season-ranked?pv=related_list\"><em>The Legend of Korra</em></a> called <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495715/avatar-the-last-airbender-how-major-characters-fit-into-the-legend-of-korra?pv=related_list\">\u201cKorra Alone\u201d</a> that\u2019s similar since it\u2019s more about internal conflict than external. But whichever episode you choose, you can\u2019t go wrong. They\u2019re both great. What I refer to as the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/podcast/2476926/why-quentin-tarantino-never-made-that-pulp-fiction-prequel\"><em>Pulp Fiction</em></a> episode, \u201cThe Tales of Ba Sing Se\u201d is split into multiple stories. Toph and Katara are having a girl day, Zuko is shy on a date, and Momo has some harrowing dreams. Aang and Sokka also have some silly adventures. But the most important story involves Iroh and his dead son, which always makes me tear up. This episode has the saddest moment in the entire series when we see Iroh crying over his son and singing. Not many shows actually move me to the point of tears, but <em>Avatar</em> does. And this segment is just proof of why. One word. Bloodbending. Team Avatar goes to a spooky town and meet a woman named Hama. Hama is a waterbender, but she also knows a dark technique that she teaches to an impressionable Katara. Unfortunately, Katara is forced to use this technique on Hama, even though she feels that it\u2019s evil to do so. Hama doesn\u2019t mind losing as long as she passes down her evil knowledge to somebody else. And now, Katara\u2019s forever tainted. I love when Avatar goes full dark\u2014which is why I love Korra\u2014and this is the darkest the series ever gets. Waterbending is supposed to be fluid and beautiful. So the fact that you can actually torture people with it is creepy on a whole other level. \u201cThe Storm\u201d is the best episode of the series since it\u2019s the one that fully humanizes Aang and Zuko, who are arguably the two best characters on the show. Aang talks about his past and how he got stuck in his iceberg in the first place (it\u2019s because of a storm), and Iroh recounts how Zuko got his scar. Aang also has to save Sokka from another storm, which shows the Avatar getting over his fears and also shows massive growth in his character development. This was the episode that got me to love <em>Avatar</em>. I\u2019m obsessed with stories about reluctant leaders with shameful backstories, and Aang\u2019s is a potent one. I also love how Zuko is shown to be so complex and troubled. Both Aang and Zuko are in a way running from their pasts and also trying to live up to people\u2019s expectations at the same time. And it\u2019s rare that you can link the hero to the villain in such a way that you feel bad for both of them. That\u2019s the power of this episode, and why it\u2019s my number one pick. But I\u2019m sure your picks are different from mine. Leave your favorites in the comments below and why you love them so much.

    "title": "5 Baby Yoda Theories About Where He Was During The Most Recent Star Wars Trilogy",
    "content": "Since first appearing in the first episode of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/The%20Mandalorian\"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a>, The Child a.k.a. Baby Yoda has been established as an <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2486166/why-the-mandalorians-creator-thinks-fans-are-so-curious-about-baby-yoda\">exciting mystery character</a> about which <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492786/every-star-wars-movie-ranked-including-the-rise-of-skywalker\"><em>Star Wars fans have obsessed</em></a>. We know he is 50 years old, is the same species as Yoda (hence the nickname), and is Force sensitive, but everything else about him is unknown \u2013 and because he hasn\u2019t matured yet and doesn\u2019t talk, he can\u2019t exactly explain himself. There is one particular question that lingers above all others, however, and that concerns his fate. Thanks to the Sequel Trilogy, <em>Star Wars</em> fans have witnessed events that take place approximately 25 years after the events in the first season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, but the character is never mentioned in any of the films, so his canon existence during that time period is unclear. Presumably it\u2019s subject matter that the Disney+ series will <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2487265/the-mandalorian-season-2-what-we-know-so-far\">eventually get to</a> as it continues to unfold its story, but as of right now all we can do is speculate with all of the evidence provided. So speculate we shall! Keeping in mind everything we know about the post-<em>Return Of The Jedi</em> portion of the <em>Star Wars</em> timeline, we\u2019ve put our mind to the possible futures that could be in store for Baby Yoda during the events of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1461409/Star-Wars-Force-Awakens\"><em>The Force Awakens</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1466089/Star-Wars-The-Last-Jedi\"><em>The Last Jedi</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1467669/star-wars-episode-ix-the-rise-of-skywalker\"><em>The Rise Of Skywalker</em></a>, and laid them out for your perusal/entertainment below: As things stand in <em>The Mandalorian</em>, Din Djarin has taken on the responsibility of a parental figure to Baby Yoda, who is viewed as a Foundling a.k.a. an adopted child in the eyes of the Mandalorian creed. There is some presumption that Djarin will continue to look for a safe place to leave him, possibly searching for The Child\u2019s original home planet, but what if that doesn\u2019t work out and they just stay together? Even if the character did show up in any of the Sequel Trilogy movies, it\u2019s possible that the audience wouldn\u2019t even recognize him because he would be wearing a helmet that he never takes off. Pivoting from that last idea to the one proposed within it, it could wind up being that <em>The Mandalorian</em> as a show is used as a vehicle to finally provide <em>Star Wars</em> fans with a bit more backstory about Yoda. While the diminutive, green Jedi master has existed in pop culture for nearly half a century, it\u2019s never been revealed what he is or where he comes from, and prior to the arrival of The Child we only saw one other similar being in the canon (<a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Yaddle\">a female named Yaddle</a>). The Disney+ series could change that by having Din Djarin find his ward\u2019s secretive homeworld, and also use that turn of events to explain where the character is 25 years later during the battle between the First Order and the Resistance. As we\u2019ve seen time and time again in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, being Force sensitive puts a target on your back. If folks aren\u2019t trying to straight up kill you, they\u2019re trying to convince you to use your abilities for evil. Because of this, the future may not be so bright for Baby Yoda \u2013 that is, unless drastic action is taken to prevent it. Following the events that play out in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, Yoda was forced to live a life in exile on Dagobah, and it may turn out that the only way for The Child to stay safe would be to pull a similar move. It may not be too great for him in the long run, as it may make him a touch nutty (a la Yoda in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>), but at least he\u2019ll be safe. The more positive angle on the exile idea is that while The Child may not be able to live a normal life in the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy, he may still be able to quietly do good things. By the time the events of the Sequel Trilogy paly out, Baby Yoda may be living in the furthest reaches of the universe, and potentially be at the center of a Jedi training program so secretive that even General Leia Organa and Luke Skywalker don\u2019t know about it. At 75 he probably still won\u2019t be all that mature, but he will have a fair amount of Force experience under his belt, and could potentially reach out to others in the universe with the gift. Maybe that\u2019s where <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2487602/what-about-broom-boy-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-writer-addresses-the-last-jedi-other-force-users\">Temiri Blagg a.k.a. Broom Boy</a> from the end of <em>The Last Jedi</em> is while <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2486987/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-review-a-disappointing-end-to-the-skywalker-saga\">all of the nonsense in <em>The Rise Of Skywalker</em></a> is going on. Ready for a trip to bummer town? The train is leaving now. Let\u2019s face facts: not only is the life of a Mandalorian a dangerous one, but the entire series began because Baby Yoda has a bounty on his head. As hard as Din Djarin may work to protect his ward, there exists the distinct possibility that he may one day fail at his duty and that The Child will be a casualty. It\u2019s admittedly hard to imagine <em>Star Wars</em> going this route given the outrage caused simply by <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2487493/yes-the-mandalorian-episode-8-most-hated-stormtroopers-voiced-by-famous-actors\">Stormtroopers giving him a few bops on the head</a>, but characters aren\u2019t immune to death in the franchise, so it\u2019s not ever totally off the table that he dies sometime between the end of <em>The Mandalorian</em> Season 1 and the beginning of <em>The Force Awakens</em>. Above are a few of the ideas that we came up with while thinking about what\u2019s going on with Baby Yoda \u2013 but we\u2019re not the only people who have pondered the question. At the press day for <em>Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker</em> late last year, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/videos/wheres-baby-yoda-been-daisy-ridley-john-boyega-and-the-rise-of-skywalker-cast-discuss/2486382/\">I posed the question</a> to Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and more members of the cast, and you can watch their responses clicking play on the video above!

    "title": "Disney+ Star Wars Shows: 8 Big Questions We Still Have About The Series",
    "content": "<em>Star Wars</em> may be out of new movies for the foreseeable future following <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, but Disney+ has some TV shows in the works that should take the galaxy far, far away <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2487850/star-wars-darksaber-what-we-know-about-the-new-lightsaber-in-the-mandalorian\">in some intriguing directions</a>. In fact, thanks to the Obi-Wan Kenobi series, the Cassian Andor-centric <em>Rogue One</em> prequel series, and <em>The Mandalorian</em> Season 2, <em>Star Wars</em> will fill in some blanks in the saga. Throw in the mysterious fourth live-action show on the way, and there\u2019s a lot to look forward to, even if we don\u2019t yet have all the details. Read on for some big questions about the Disney+ <em>Star Wars</em> series that are on the way! One of the most highly-anticipated <em>Star Wars</em> projects on the way has to be the Obi-Wan Kenobi series featuring Ewan McGregor reprising his role from the prequel trilogy. The show is set to pick up eight years after <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>. Fans had every reason to believe that Obi-Wan was simply meditating in the desert on Tatooine for the better part of two decades before the events of <em>A New Hope</em>, so the show should reveal that more was going on for Obi-Wan than we knew. But will he get more than one season? When the Obi-Wan project <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2478587/ewan-mcgregor-is-officially-returning-as-obi-wan-kenobi-for-disney-series\">was first announced</a>, it was described as a \u201climited series,\u201d which indicates a one-off run of episodes starring Ewan McGregor. That said, the announcement came back in the summer of 2019, and the project has <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2493800/disneys-ewan-mcgregor-obi-wan-series-is-moving-forward-with-exciting-news-behind-the-scenes\">gone through some creative changes</a> in the months since. Of course, <em>Star Wars</em> probably can\u2019t give Obi-Wan many adventures when he\u2019s supposed to be watching over Luke, but fans likely wouldn\u2019t say no to more than one season. The series centered on Cassian Andor (and starring <em>Rogue One</em>\u2019s Diego Luna) will more or less be a prequel as it tells Cassian\u2019s story leading to the man he was when he met Jyn Erso. According to <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/news/new-casting-announced-for-cassian-andor-live-action-series\">StarWars.com</a>, the show will take place five years before the events of <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495101/disneys-rogue-one-prequel-adds-another-star-wars-movie-star\">feature some familiar faces</a> for <em>Star Wars</em> fans. While that timeline suggests the series could run for five seasons and end right before the beginning of <em>Rogue One</em>, that\u2019s not necessarily the case. Just like the Obi-Wan series will pick up and presumably close between the events of <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> and <em>A New Hope</em>, the Cassian Andor series could end short of right before <em>Rogue One</em>. Disney+ didn\u2019t hand down a five-season order for the project, and another <em>Star Wars</em> TV show set in the very same era <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2455378/why-star-wars-rebels-ended-before-the-original-trilogy-timeline\">ended before <em>Rogue One</em></a>. If <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> didn\u2019t dive into <em>Rogue One</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1643220/the-huge-rogue-one-question-star-wars-rebels-will-answer-in-season-4\">aside from some setup</a>, we shouldn\u2019t 100% count on Cassian\u2019s series doing it either, and can only wait and see. While it may seem like an <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2496080/the-mandalorian-cast-battlestar-galacticas-katee-sackhoff-for-season-2-in-a-familiar-role\">awful lot of details</a> are dropping for <em>The Mandalorian</em> Season 2 (compared to Season 1, at least), Disney+ hasn\u2019t yet released any footage for the next adventures of Mando and Baby Yoda, which may or may not take the dynamic duo to face a \u201crace of enemy sorcerers,\u201d to quote Mando himself when describing the Jedi. Not even a teaser has hit the web, so fans are in the dark on official content regarding Mando and Baby Yoda, Moff Gideon and the Darksaber, and everything else. So when will footage release? Well, the Disney+ series will return for its second season in October 2020, so we can at least speculate. Season 1 premiered in November 2019, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2478578/the-mandalorian-trailer-reveals-a-deadly-new-side-of-star-wars-for-first-live-action-series\">the first official trailer</a> released in late August 2019, with the second full trailer debuting in October. If Season 2 follows approximately the same timeline, then the first trailer could reveal some new <em>Mandalorian</em> footage in July 2020. That said, Disney+ has already <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492958/surprise-now-disney-will-be-adding-pixars-onward-way-early-too\">dropped some surprises</a>, and I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if the final episode of <a href=\"https://disneyplusoriginals.disney.com/show/disney-gallery-the-mandalorian\"><em>Disney Gallery: The Mandalorian</em></a> ends on a teaser. While Disney+ hasn\u2019t officially announced overwhelming amounts of details regarding <em>The Mandalorian</em> Season 2 and the series for Obi-Wan and Cassian, far less is known about <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2494956/a-new-star-wars-show-is-coming-to-disney-from-netflix-showrunner\">the fourth live-action <em>Star Wars</em></a> show in the works at the streamer. In the official confirmation of the show, all <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/news/taika-waititi-announce\">StarWars.com</a> revealed on May 4, 2020 is that Emmy-nominated writer Leslye Headland, who co-created and ran <em>Russian Doll</em> for Netflix, is developing a new untitled <em>Star Wars</em> show for Disney+. So, what\u2019s happening with this project? According to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/star-wars-series-leslye-headland-disney-plus-1234587493/\">Variety</a> in a report released in April, before <em>Star Wars</em> dropped the confirmation, the show hailing from Leslye Headland will be female-centric and take place elsewhere in the <em>Star Wars</em> timeline than other projects. If accurate and eventually corroborated by Disney, we can probably rule out crossovers between this series and the others at Disney+, but we can\u2019t do much more than wonder at this point. Although the first season of <em>The Mandalorian</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2478574/boba-fett-wont-appear-in-the-mandalorian-but-theres-good-news\">deliberately avoided connections</a> to the movies and stood on its own, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case for Season 2 and certainly isn\u2019t the case for the shows centered on Ewan McGregor\u2019s Obi-Wan Kenobi and Diego Luna\u2019s Cassian Andor, both of whom of course joined the <em>Star Wars</em> saga via movies. Mon Mothma has already been confirmed for the <em>Rogue One</em> prequel series, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2496199/star-wars-rumors-jimmy-smits-bail-organa-and-more-may-be-heading-to-cassian-andor-series\">two others from <em>Rogue One</em></a> are rumored. But who else, and which shows? Well, Ahsoka Tano and Bo-Katan of <em>The Clone Wars</em> along with Boba Fett (played <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495924/the-mandalorian-casts-star-wars-movie-star-to-play-boba-fett-in-season-2\">by a familiar face</a>) are said to be coming to <em>The Mandalorian</em> Season 2, and the Obi-Wan show is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495820/disneys-obi-wan-kenobi-show-is-rumored-to-be-recruiting-another-prequel-trilogy-star\">rumored to feature Hayden Christensen</a> as well. The Cassian Andor series arguably has the most potential for movie characters thanks to its placement in the <em>Star Wars</em> timeline. I for one am hoping for some <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> TV characters in his show <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1606180/the-cool-way-rogue-one-almost-connected-to-star-wars-rebels\">thanks to the timeline overlap</a>, but the movies give us plenty of characters to speculate about joining the four shows while we wait for official information. An Obi-Wan Kenobi-centric project was rumored for years before it was finally confirmed as a series for Disney+ rather than an anthology movie a la <em>Solo</em> and <em>Rogue One</em>. Ewan McGregor <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2489482/baby-kenobi-ewan-mcgregor-watched-the-mandalorian-as-prep-for-his-own-star-wars-series\">has been prepping</a> to reprise his role, and those rumors of cancellation <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2488776/phew-the-obi-wan-kenobi-disney-plus-cancellation-rumor-has-been-debunked\">proved to be unfounded</a>. That said, McGregor himself confirmed some delays back in January. According to McGregor, the plan to start shooting in August 2020 was bumped back to January 2021. So will we have to wait way longer for the show? Ewan McGregor also shared that he doesn\u2019t expect the filming delays to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2489057/ewan-mcgregor-explains-obi-wan-kenobi-tv-show-delays\">affect the premiere date</a>, which had never been announced, and this was before television productions had to start shutting down throughout the industry. As of now, there are no guarantees that the show will be able to begin filming on time, let alone make its original intended premiere date\u2026 whatever that was. Despite casting seemingly still being ongoing as recently as mid-May, the Cassian Andor series set ahead of <em>Rogue One</em> seemed like the most likely live-action <em>Star Wars</em> series to debut after <em>The Mandalorian</em>. Announced <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2461073/star-wars-next-live-action-series-will-be-a-rogue-one-prequel\">back in November 2018</a>, the project was able to begin production back in winter 2020, and a 2021 premiere date seemed very possible. Unfortunately, the Cassian series -- like <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2492950/updated-list-of-major-tv-show-delays-or-ending-early-due-to-coronavirus\">many others</a> -- had to shut down production much earlier than intended. How much was actually completed? According to <em>Star Wars</em> special effects artist Neal Scanlan, the project was <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2493535/how-far-disneys-cassian-andor-star-wars-show-got-before-coronavirus-shutdown\">in production for four weeks</a> before the shutdown, which presumably means that not a whole lot was done, and the industry-wide shutdown still hasn\u2019t ended as of the end of May. The very early production halt could mean a significant delay for this show, although I\u2019d still put money on the Cassian series releasing before the Obi-Wan series on Disney+. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see if details are released about what was finished. The most recent Disney+ <em>Star Wars</em> release wasn\u2019t actually <em>The Mandalorian</em>, but rather the final season of its original animated series, <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em>. In fact, the first few <em>Star Wars</em> series ever were animated, with <em>Clone Wars</em> in the prequel era and <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> ahead of the original trilogy becoming fan-favorites. With animation not having to abide by some of the visual rules that limit live-action <em>Star Wars</em> projects, such as the epic final duel between Ahsoka and Maul in <em>Clone Wars</em>, could <em>Star Wars</em> return to animation for another show? Well, there\u2019s no denying the success of <em>Clone Wars</em> and <em>Rebels</em>, although <em>Rebels</em> to a somewhat lesser degree. That said, <em>Clone Wars</em> and <em>Rebels</em> boss (and <em>Mandalorian</em> executive producer) Dave Filoni told <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/clone-wars-series-finale-dave-filoni-interview-ahsoka-tano-mandalorian-1202927520/\">Deadline</a> following the <em>Clone Wars</em> finale that he\u2019s \u201creally focused\u201d on <em>The Mandalorian</em>, and he has a \u201cbunch of things\u201d that he\u2019s \u201cpreparing and mulling over.\u201d I\u2019m not sure I see Disney+ moving forward on another animated show without Filoni at the helm, but the success of <em>Clone Wars</em> and <em>Rebels</em> proves that there\u2019s an audience for animated <em>Star Wars</em> TV. The question may be more of <em>when</em> another animated series could happen than <em>if</em>. Hopefully <a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/\">Disney+</a> and <em>Star Wars</em> will start dropping details sooner rather than later, or at least a bit of <em>Mandalorian</em> Season 2 footage to tide us over. The good news is that the streamer is packed with <em>Star Wars</em> content, including all the movies, the first season of <em>The Mandalorian</em>, and a whole lot of <em>Star Wars</em> animation to check out.

    "title": "Titanic: 10 Behind-The-Scenes Facts About James Cameron's Epic Movie",
    "content": "There is no doubt about it, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/titanic\"><em>Titanic</em></a> is one of the biggest movies to hit the big screen. Released in late 1997, James Cameron's epic disaster period piece about the ill-fated maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic, was one of the cultural touchstone of the decade and the made stars out of many members of the cast. But as beautiful, exciting, and the heartbreaking as the film is, the behind the scenes facts from the film's production are just as exciting. Like any billion-dollar movie (especially when they weren't dime-a-dozen like they are now), there was a lot that went into <em>Titanic</em>. With some of the incidents that happened on the set of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/james-cameron\">James Cameron</a>'s second most successful theatrical release, it's amazing that we are even able to debate whether or not Jack could fit on the board in the first place. Here are 10 behind the scenes facts from James Cameron's epic, <em>Titanic</em>. Starting things off, we have the time the production (cast and crew) on the Canadian set inadvertently ingested PCP (a hallucinogen) on the final night of shooting. According to a rather engaging <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ypaq3g/remembering-when-everyone-filming-titanic-got-spiked-with-pcp\">Vice</a> article on the incident, the cast and crew were taking a break from the dusk-to-dawn shooting to have a midnight lunch when someone noticed something was up with the clam chowder (which everyone had eaten with some going back for seconds and thirds). Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were not on set that day. In the article, standby painter Marilyn McAvoy revealed that she first noticed something was up about 30 minutes after eating a bowl of the spiked-chowder when she started to feel dizzy and confused. Shortly thereafter, McAvoy noticed that other people on set were starting to feel the same effects, and they were all rushed to a nearby hospital, stating: If you listen to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482176/titanic-how-historically-accurate-was-the-1997-movie-starring-leonardo-dicaprio\">James Cameron talk about <em>Titanic</em> long enough</a>, you will see just how passionate the director was about the project. If years of pre-production, which included embarking upon several dives to the site of the wreckage, wasn't enough to the prove that this was more than just another movie for Cameron, then this next bit of information should do the trick. <em>Titanic</em> was originally going to cost around $120 million to produce, but as the production carried on, that figure skyrocketed up to $200 million. During an interview around the time the movie was released in 1997, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496359/james-camerons-favorite-guilty-pleasure-movie-is-not-what-youd-probably-guess\">James Cameron</a> appeared on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUKu_zODapQ\">The Howard Stern Show</a> where he revealed that he gave all his money back as a sign of good faith, stating: Cameron went on to explain that while he still held the authorship of the movie, he did not receive a salary and wouldn't receive money on the backend after its release. Upon the release of <em>Titanic</em> to the end of the time, the line, \"I'm the king of the world\" will go down as one of the most iconic moments in cinematic history. But like all great things in movie-making, the actual words were made up on the spot. During an interview with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmMvgisxymE\">BBC Radio 1</a> in 2019, James Cameron explained that he had been working with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/leonardo-dicaprio\">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> on the scene where he stands on the front of the ship for quite some time but couldn't come up with the right words to give the moment its extra flair until the final moment: It's crazy to think about now, but <em>Titanic</em>, one of the most successful movies of all time, was considered a failure before it even hit theaters. I know, crazy, right? But we have hindsight in our favor these days, unlike the press and studio in the months leading up to the film's release. In a 2017 op-ed in <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/james-camerons-titanic-secrets-time-i-gave-my-version-what-happened-996442\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, James Cameron recounted all the drama that surrounded the project early on in production all the way to the days leading up film's premiere. Cameron goes into great detail about the treatment he and the movie received from the press leading to the release, especially before Paramount pushed back the release: Up until the spring 1997, <em>Titanic</em> was scheduled to hit theaters over the July 4 weekend, but as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/21/movies/hollywood-braces-for-likely-delay-of-titanic.html\">New York Times</a> described it, the most expensive film ever made was pushed back as there was no way to fast-track the new and complicated computer effects that make up a large portion of the movie. According to the same article, pushing the movie back until the late fall of that year had a ripple effect on Hollywood after Paramount and 20th Century Fox (RIP) decided to vacate the July 2, 1997, opening date to work out the kinks in post-production. One of the most talked about scenes in <em>Titanic</em> after its release was the iconic <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Kate-Winslet-Titanic-Nude-Scene-Restored-Indian-Re-Release-30213.html\">\"Draw me like one of your French girls\"</a> scene in Rose's (Kate Winslet) first-class quarters. It was the moment where you got to see Jack Dawson's (Leonardo Dicaprio) artistry come to life, but it actually wasn't DiCaprio behind the pencil. During a 2017 appearance on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLgxSXoQE0k\">The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</a>, Kate Winslet answered a series of questions about the movie, which included one about this particular scene. In the middle of the interview, Winslet blurted Before James Cameron and company decided to cast Leonardo DiCaprio as the leading man Jack Dawson in <em>Titanic</em>, another well-regarded and sought after actor was really close to being cast instead. Enter <a href=\"http://cinemablend.com/news/2460920/matthew-mcconaughey-could-have-played-jack-in-titanic\">Matthew McConaughey</a>. At the time of the casting, McConaughey wasn't the name he is today, but the Texan actor had already won audiences over in the 1993 <em>Daze And Confused</em>. During a 2018 appearance on <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/awards-chatter-podcast-matthew-mcconaughey-white-boy-rick-1148521\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>'s Awards Chatter podcast, the one-day Oscar-winning actor revealed that he even auditioned alongside Kate Winslet, which made him feel like he had the part, stating: The grand wooden staircase was at the center of multiple scenes throughout <em>Titanic</em>, including one when water begins crashing in from the glass ceiling as the doomed ship makes its way to the depths of the frigid Atlantic Ocean. That scene could have been <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1730920/the-wooden-staircase-in-titanic-was-almost-a-total-disaster\">even more terrifying</a> if filming hadn't been stopped by James Cameron, as the director explained in the documentary <a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/titanic-20-years-later-with-james-cameron/133QEwnfPqw5\"><em>Titanic: 20 Years Later</em></a>: Pretty much anytime a movie or television series that has anything or nothing to do with astronomy, famed astronomer and resident Debbie Downer <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/397929/How-An-Astronomer-Convinced-James-Cameron-Re-Edit-Titanic\">Neil deGrasse Tyson is there to point out each and every flaw</a>. James Cameron and <em>Titanic</em> were no different. Ahead of 2012 3D re-release of <em>Titanic</em>, James Cameron revealed to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/9179090/James-Cameron-reshoots-Titanic-scene.html\">The Telegraph</a> that he had received a \"snarky\" email from Neil deGrasse Tyson about the much-debated driftwood scene, but it didn't have to deal with if there was room for Jack on the board, stating: That's right, an email from an astronomer convinced one of the greatest directors of our time to make a subtle and hard to find change to one of his most successful movies. After more than three hours of love and tragedy throughout the course of <em>Titanic</em>, audiences were given a fairytale ending with the older Rose (Gloria Stuart) dropping the \"Heart Of The Ocean\" into sea before passing in her sleep and joining her long-lost love on the ship where they first met. At one point, however, the scene of Rose letting go of her past was going to be much longer and involved Bill Paxton's character Brock Lovett catching her tossing the diamond in the ocean. Often described as one of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/546209/Titanic-Alternate-Ending-Might-Worst-Thing-You-Ever-Seen\">worst things you've ever seen</a>, a lot of people weren't fond of the extended ending, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1629690/how-bill-paxton-really-felt-about-the-titanic-alternate-ending-getting-cut\">including the late Bill Paxton</a>, who once told <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bill-paxton-on-the-alternate-ending-of-titanic-audiences-didnt-see-in-1997-150538039.html\">Yahoo</a> that it was totally unnecessary, and he was glad it was cut, even if it meant less screen time for him: The extended scene doesn't really make sense in the grand scheme of things and only makes an already long movie even longer. And if Bill Paxton said he was glad to see it go, then you have to just go with it. Those are just 10 of the craziest behind the scenes facts from James Cameron's 1997 disaster epic, <em>Titanic</em>. Were any of these a surprise to you or is this stuff you already knew?

    "title": "Young Spider-Man Fans Hospitalized After Letting Black Widow Bite Them In Hopes Of Getting Superpowers",
    "content": "Superheroes and comic book characters have entertained the public for decades, usually starting with kids who eventually become adult fans. Plenty of us have dreamed of the day we might get our own superheroic powers, wether by evolution, radiation, or a spider-bite. Although a group of young men in Bolivia took these stories a bit too literally, as they reportedly let a black widow spider bite them in an attempt to gain their own powers <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495927/watch-tobey-maguires-shirtless-spider-man-screen-test\">a la Peter Parker</a>. Don't try this one at home, kids. The incident in question happened in the country of Bolivia, and involved three boys with ages ranging from 8-12. They found a black widow spider while reportedly herding goats in the province of Chayanta. And when they discovered the spider, the boys poked it with sticks repeatedly until they were each bitten. Unfortunately, the group didn't start climbing walls and developing a spider-sense as a result of this encounter. According to <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/05/25/boys-let-black-widow-bite-them-in-hopes-of-turning-into-spider-man/\">The New York Post</a>, the boys mother actually found the trio crying over their wounds, before rushing them to a nearby hospital. Black widow bites are known to affect the nervous system, due to the venom secreted by the spider. While Peter Parker became a bonafide superhero as a result of his bite in the Spider-Man comics and various film adaptations, that wasn't the case for the three Bolivian boys who had subjected themselves to their own bite. Luckily, there is a happy ending at the end of this harrowing tale that is sure to inspire a few nightmares for parents out there. The boys reportedly spent a week in various hospitals, suffering from fevers and tremors during their stay in treatment. But all three were released from the hospital, and likely won't be messing with any big spiders in the future. Even if they want to suit up and join The Avengers. Spider-Man is one of Marvel's most popular heroes, and Peter Parker's adventure as the web crawler has been adapted from the comics into various other forms of media. The character will continue to dominate pop culture in the coming years, particularly on the big screen. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546875/spider-man-far-from-home-concept-art-gives-hydro-man-a-much-different-look\">Tom Holland is playing</a> a live-action Spider-Man in the MCU, while Sony is developing its <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2504035/the-new-spider-man-universe-madame-web-movie-is-one-step-closer-to-moving-forward\">own cinematic universe</a> with Spidey foes like Venom and Morbius.

Thankfully, the 2020 film\u2019s favorable run with fans and critics alike worked well enough to have one specific effect on the franchise. As it turns out, Sonic has become a bit of a hot commodity yet again. At least that\u2019s the impression Sega of America\u2019s Chief Brand Officer, Ivo Gerscovich, seemed to impart during a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/go02cw/im_ivo_gerscovich_chief_brand_officer_for_sonic/frdjz6d/\">Reddit</a> AMA. When asked how the movie had impacted the Sonic brand overall, Gerscovich laid down the state of the series as follows: Before the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> movie was released into theaters, there was <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477697/sonic-the-hedgehog-a-history-of-the-backlash-and-delays-so-far\">a hard, skeptical road</a> the film would have to travel down. With <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2490300/why-jim-carrey-thinks-sonic-the-hedgehogs-redesign-made-the-movie-much-better\">a huge character redesign</a> prompting a delayed release, and an overall lack of confidence in the movie\u2019s early trailer, it looked like director Jeff Fowler\u2019s big video game adaptation might end up being another failed attempt to make what worked on the console into a blockbuster cinematic experience. And then, the fans came into the picture. <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493888/sonic-the-hedgehogs-ben-schwartz-explains-the-character-redesign-and-benefit-of-backlash\">not only looked more like himself</a> in the post-redesign advertisements, but the movie also seemed to get a lot of mojo because of it. Flash forward to now, and even in an abbreviated theatrical run, the James Marsden and Ben Schwartz-led buddy comedy made some serious history. With great success comes great demand, as the buzz surrounding <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494110/classic-sonic-characters-sonic-the-hedgehog-2-needs-to-introduce\">a potential <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em></a> started to settle into a steady clip. In turn, the video game franchise that inspired this particular film is going to become a hotter prospect as well. And if you thought fans were skeptical about the <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> movie, you should read into some of the history behind the video games that have been made throughout decades of console gaming history. The <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> fandom turned its native franchise from a dormant brand destined for cinematic failure into a modestly successful picture that has now reignited an old favorite. There\u2019s a very thin line between nostalgia and relevance, and all it took was a movie made from the heart to speed across that very crucial border. <em>Sonic The Hedgehog</em> is <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36gJinN\">currently available on Digital HD</a>, as well as in the physical formats of 4K UHD, Blu-ray and DVD. So if you\u2019re looking to see what everyone\u2019s getting revved up about, now\u2019s probably a good time. CinemaBlend's James Bond (expert).

    "title": "Why The Tenet Trailer Has Us Concerned About The Movie\u2019s Fate",
    "content": "The unveiling of the new trailer for writer/director Christopher Nolan\u2019s <em>Tenet</em> has raised even more questions about the enigmatic filmmaker\u2019s latest offering. While <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546638/tenets-new-trailer-finally-reveals-what-christopher-nolans-movie-is-about\">the second look</a> at this time-skewing adventure has definitely answered some of the questions we\u2019ve had about the film since its announcement, there\u2019s a pretty big concern that\u2019s popped up as a result. As it turns out, this new trailer had no release date attached to the end, which now has many concerned about <em>Tenet\u2019s</em> fate overall. An entire pattern of thought unravels around this particular subject, as the lack of the concrete July 17 date casts doubt over whether that long held deadline will be upheld. In case you haven\u2019t seen it for yourself, or might have missed the sneaky lack of a release date at the end, here\u2019s the new trailer for <em>Tenet</em>: Alright, now let's delve into the release date of it all... or rather, lack thereof. Previously, the first footage shown from the film ended with the bold claim that time would run out on July 17, 2020. And up until <em>Tenet\u2019s</em> second trailer, that had been the company line that Warner Bros, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494531/cinemark-shares-plans-for-theaters-reopening\">major theater chains</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495917/christopher-nolan-still-pushing-for-new-movie-tenet-to-open-theaters-but-its-not-his-choice\">even Christopher Nolan himself</a> had upheld. Now it seems only fitting that this new trailer show so many title cards over shattered glass, as that message looks to be crumbling itself. It\u2019s only a partial collapse though, as <em>Tenet</em> still promises the film will be \u201ccoming to theaters.\u201d Which, undoubtedly, was always going to be the plan. However, <em>Tenet\u2019s</em> new lack of release date does signal something folks have been hoping for amid the climate of current events. This new messaging from Warner Bros is more than likely a sign that John David Washington and Robert Pattinson\u2019s adventures in time inversion are going to be pushed to another calendar slot. The good news about this situation is that the fans who really wanted <em>Tenet</em> to be delayed a little further in the name of safety could get their wish. Alas, that does open up another can of worms, as Warner Bros\u2019 2020 has been slightly more chaotic than most other studios. Though every studio has been hit with scenarios that have delayed the release of cinematic products, there\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496583/what-will-happen-to-dune-that-probably-depends-on-tenet-and-wonder-woman-1984-godzilla-tenet-warner-bros\">a chain of big ticket tentpole films</a> that this studio has to deal with. If there is to be a rescheduling of <em>Tenet</em>, then the August 14 date <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> currently holds will probably be the date that will be reserved for Christopher Nolan\u2019s $200+ million <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546792/christopher-nolans-tenet-trailer-reveals-an-awesome-practical-stunt\">plane-crashing mind bender</a>. That will potentially push the Gal Gadot starring DC Comics\u2019 sequel into the release date previously intended for either <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> or <em>Dune</em>. The chances of success for all four of these films is important to Warner Bros, but clearly something has to give in terms of what\u2019s being released into theaters. <em>Tenet</em> and <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> are clearly the golden armored geese in this particular stable of titles, so them being released in 2020 is the priority. So on top of delaying <em>Tenet</em> into a brand new release slot, there\u2019s now the greater implication that a new release date would result in an awkwardly tepid response. Not to mention that fans of any of those other franchises might feel a little sore about the return of said appreciated franchises being delayed. One thing that\u2019s certain is that <em>Tenet</em> will not be going to premium video on demand, similar to how <em>Scoob!</em> debuted earlier this month. With the huge budgetary and marketing spend on the line, Warner Bros is going to want the greatest return of investment on its latest Christopher Nolan gamble. Not to mention that the 35mm and IMAX 70mm prints are probably already sitting in a warehouse, waiting to unspool in front of audiences lucky enough to have the chance to see them. Should you be someone who thought this was going to be another red carpet premiere in your living room, we send our regrets. The next couple of weeks should be interesting in terms of <em>Tenet</em> news, as the folks at Warner Bros are probably using a special slide rule that games out exactly what happens should the film be moved to any particular date. In the meantime, two tension-filled questions will be occupying a lot of people's minds: when is <em>Tenet</em> going to be pushed off to, and which film is going to get the bump into 2021 as a result? We'll more than likely learn both of those answers at the same time, which combines both of those mysteries into one greater mystery, much like any good Christopher Nolan project would strive to do. The greatest question surrounding <em>Tenet</em> right now is when we'll discover the details of its newly-drafted fate. If I were to venture a guess, I'd say mid-June would be the latest we'll hear about the changed status of the summer blockbuster. Right now, <em>Tenet</em> is under a microscope when it comes to its mysterious plot. While the mechanics of how time inversion works are enough to tease and taunt the audience into most of the discussion surrounding this movie, it's all going to lead back to when exactly the public at large will get to see it for themselves. Good old fashioned waiting is going to eventually yield the answers to all these questions, but even at this moment, there's a small sliver of hope that <em>Tenet</em> will stay on track with its originally planned debut. It might not pan out, but the decision to use this film as the first major blockbuster to open once theaters go back into business is definitely sound. Questions almost always lead to hype, especially when it's a Christopher Nolan film at the center of it all. As the latest trailer may not state it as a bedrock fact, <a href=\"https://www.tenetfilm.com/\"><em>Tenet\u2019s</em> own official website</a> still has the film as slated to push time forwards and backwards on July 17, only in theaters. But when and if that changes, you can count on CinemaBlend to break that news as it happens. In the meantime, keep track of what other movies are expected to hit theaters later this year with our <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480313/new-movie-releases-2020-movie-release-date-schedule\">2020 release schedule</a>.

    "title": "Why Indiana Jones 5 Was Right To Bring On Logan's Director, According To The Producer",
    "content": "Each <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie has unique elements to distinguish it from <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481371/indiana-jones-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best\">the other entries</a>, but the upcoming <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> is particularly special due to the fact that it\u2019ll <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2490898/steven-spielberg-wont-direct-indiana-jones-5-after-all\">be the first not to be directed by Steven Spielberg</a>. Instead, <em>Logan</em> and <em>Ford v Ferrari</em> filmmaker James Mangold will sit in the director\u2019s chair, and producer Frank Marshall is confident that Mangold was the right choice to take the reins for <em>Indiana Jones 5</em>. Frank Marshall summarized his positive feelings about James Mangold working on <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> thusly: When a new director comes aboard a franchise, it certainly helps if they were already a fan of said franchise. Combine that with James Mangold having already struck up a good dynamic with Indiana Jones himself, Harrison Ford, and an impressive filmography that also includes <em>Walk the Line</em>, <em>3:10 to Yuma</em> and <em>The Wolverine</em>, and as Frank Marshall sees it, that\u2019s a winning formula for a suitable person to succeed Steven Spielberg on <em>Indiana Jones 5</em>. It was reported back in February that Steven Spielberg was stepping away from directing <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> because he wanted to \u201cpass along Indy\u2019s whip to a new generation to bring their perspective to the story.\u201d Spielberg is still involved as a producer, but now Indiana Jones fans finally have an opportunity to see what this film series can look like with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2490951/steven-spielberg-leaving-indiana-jones-5-reopens-debate-about-whether-there-should-even-be-a-movie\">someone new overseeing the filming process</a>. During his interview with <a href=\"https://collider.com/indiana-jones-5-update-script-james-mangold-frank-marshall/\">Collider</a>, Frank Marshall also mentioned that the writing process on <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> has \u201cjust started.\u201d That\u2019s somewhat surprising, because even ignoring all the <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> drafts that have been set aside over the years, you\u2019d think that when James Mangold came aboard, there was at least a bare bones narrative shared with him. Then again, perhaps when Mangold was hired to direct, the creative team decided to start from scratch so that the filmmaker could be involved with crafting the story. Regardless, don\u2019t expect <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> to begin production anytime soon, as Frank Marshall added that due to the current health crisis, him, James Mangold and everyone else piloting the <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> ship are keeping a close eye on new safety guidelines and figuring out other solutions. Back in February, Harrison Ford said that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2490228/harrison-ford-reveals-when-indiana-jones-5-will-begin-filming\">filming was going to begin in April</a>, but obviously that never happened. As a result, this means it\u2019ll be a long time before <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> is released in theaters. The movie had previously been penciled into the July 9, 2021 slot, but in early April, it was among the many movies that Disney pushed back. It\u2019s now scheduled for July 29, 2022, but it\u2019s entire possible that could it could be <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494051/indiana-jones-5s-new-release-date-and-all-of-the-other-major-obstacles-its-faced\">pushed back yet again</a> somewhere down the line.

    "title": "Pamela Anderson Has Some Blunt Thoughts About The Rock\u2019s Baywatch Reboot",
    "content": "If anyone were to have thoughts about <em>Baywatch</em> as a movie versus <em>Baywatch</em> as a TV series, I\u2019d expect it to be Pamela Anderson, who built an entire career out of playing C.J. in the popular TV series and seemed to really enjoy the gig. Unfortunately, if you were to ask her about her feelings on The Rock\u2019s take on the franchise, she\u2019s less positive about how the movie came out. It\u2019s worth noting that Pamela Anderson did admit she saw the 2017 version of <em>Baywatch</em>, which starred Zac Efron and Dwayne Johnson, but she also was pretty blunt when she explained why she\u2019s not a fan, telling <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMDoVVL2zcA&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><em>Watch What Happens Live</em></a>\u2019s Andy Cohen: Ahead of the release of Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron\u2019s <em>Baywatch</em>, there was a lot of attention on the fact <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1691720/how-pamela-anderson-feels-about-the-nudity-and-bad-language-in-the-baywatch-movie\">the movie would be an R-rated comedy</a> that was expected to be a raunch comedy. While the film had a lot of hype, it ended up being broader and featured more generic humor than expected. Its story also fell flat, both with critics and audiences at the box office--particularly in domestic markets. On an alleged $69 million budget, the movie only made a little over $177 million worldwide, so it certainly could have been worse. However, the majority of that money came <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1679239/one-place-baywatch-has-actually-been-a-huge-hit\">from international markets</a>, markets where the studio takes home a much smaller percentage of the overall movie intake. A better way to look at this given the star power may be to look at a ranking of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485887/10-highest-grossing-dwayne-johnson-movies\">Dwayne Johnson movies by box office intake</a>. By that measure, <em>Baywatch</em> doesn\u2019t come anywhere close to the Top 10. In fact, it ranks 25th. Although Pamela Anderson, who was more known as a TV star and not a film actress during her heyday, went on to elaborate that by going \u201cbig budget\u201d with <em>Baywatch</em> the film lost its charm. There\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-11-28-ca-207-story.html\">LA Times</a> article from the \u201890s citing <em>Baywatch</em>\u2019s David Hasselhoff revealing \u201cless is more\u201d was a slogan those who worked on the show were familiar with. Episodes were made for around $40,000 apiece and the action sequences were decidedly not why people watched. In short, it <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2387482/why-hbo-is-concerned-with-the-budget-for-game-of-thrones-spinoffs\">wasn\u2019t exactly <em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, but the tone and budget were part of the reasons the show was a success for a decade on television, eventually even spawning a <em>Hawaii</em> version and a spinoff <em>Baywatch Nights</em>. Hyping up <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1610880/nsfw-baywatch-trailer-has-babes-explosions-and-multiple-f-bombs\">the action, the star power and the f-bombs</a>, in Pamela Anderson\u2019s opinion, wasn\u2019t the right way to go about it. Interestingly, David Hasselhoff has been equally blunt about the <em>Baywatch</em> big screen movie previously, saying it wasn't anything like his <em>Baywatch</em> and was decidedly closer to <em>Dirty Grandpa</em>, though he tried to be nice about the cast <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1694999/what-david-hasselhoff-really-thinks-about-the-rocks-nsfw-baywatch-movie\">after making that statement</a>. I'm willing to guess if you took a poll of all the former <em>Baywatch</em> TV actors they might feel similarly about the differences between the TV show and the big screen debut. Meanwhile, I'm equally willing to guess we won't be getting a <em>Baywatch 2</em> anytime soon. Amazing Race &amp; Top Chef superfan with a pinch of Disney fairy dust thrown in.

    "title": "The Snyder Cut May Be More Expensive Than We Thought",
    "content": "This week has been a dizzying one for DC fans, particularly related to <em>Justice League</em>. Because after years of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546856/with-the-snyder-cut-coming-dc-fans-are-destroying-their-copies-of-justice-league\">fan campaigning</a> and crowdfunding, The Snyder Cut will finally become a reality <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496562/release-the-snyder-cut-zack-snyders-justice-league-going-to-hbo-max\">over on HBO Max</a>. Snyder and company have been given a massive budget by the streaming service, which should allow the filmmaker to complete the process of editing, visual effects, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546790/looks-like-zack-snyders-justice-league-cut-wont-involve-reshoots-with-the-original-cast\">and ADR</a>. And now it looks like the budget may be even more hefty than we originally anticipated. HBO Max and Zack Snyder only recently revealed their plans for <em>Justice League</em>'s Snyder Cut quickly breaking the internet in the process. The mythical alternate cut originally seemed like a pipe dream, but Snyder's full vision is coming to streaming, possibly in multiple installments. The original report indicated that the budget was ranging from $20-30 million, although the head of HBO Max recently indicated it would be even more expensive. As Bob Greenblatt put it, Well, that was honest. It looks like the Snyder Cut hasn't actually been cut together just yet. And when you add in the additional visual effects that will be necessary to bring action sequences and characters like Cyborg to life, HBO Max is going to have to put out a pretty penny in order to complete Zack Snyder's original vision for <em>Justice League</em>. And the streaming service's boss seems to think it'll be over $30 million. Bob Greenblatt's comments about the Snyder Cut come from his recent appearance on the podcast <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/5LjvxFRWaqPwb72ZfQh2CT?si=UnyiGRFCS4-F1xs8Vj37rw&amp;nd=1&amp;t=0\"><em>Recode Media</em></a>. Greenblatt spoke to his plans for HBO Max, which will include content new and old for subscribers. Eventually the conversation turned Zack Snyder's alternate version of <em>Justice League</em>, where it was revealed that the past budget estimations might not have been entirely accurate; it's probably going to be even more expensive. Considering how many high concepts and over the top action that Zack Snyder had in store for <em>Justice League</em>, it make sense that it's going to be an extremely pricy investment for HBO Max. Snyder was doing a ton of world building in the movie, with underwater scenes in Atlantis, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546877/watch-justice-leagues-cyborg-actor-get-emotional-about-the-snyder-cut-happening\">and Cyborg's</a> CGI appearance. Comic book movies are famously expensive to produce, partly due to the extensive visual effects needed to bring superheroes to life. And since it also looks like the Snyder Cut will be a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546729/could-the-snyder-cut-lead-to-justice-league-2-and-more\">particularly long product</a>, there's a ton of work to do before it finally arrives. It should be interesting to see what Zack Snyder has in store for <em>Justice League</em>'s alternate cut. He's been <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493893/new-snyder-cut-images-bring-back-lois-lane-and-martha-kent\">slowly revealing</a> information and stills from unseen footage in the years since <em>Justice League</em> was released, so it's never been far from his mind. But as Bob Greenblatt indicated, the movie hasn't been completed just yet, so there's no telling when we might see the first glimpse. <em>Justice League</em>'s Snyder Cut is expected to hit HBO Max sometime in 2021, while the DCEU will continue with <em>Wonder Woman 1984</em> on August 14th.

    "title": "Watch Tom Hanks And The Splash Cast Reunite For Nostalgic Fun With Josh Gad",
    "content": "While many are now starting to venture out, most of the world remains in self-quarantine due to the global health crisis. Most would agree that it\u2019s been somewhat difficult to stay indoors for so long, but it hasn\u2019t been without a silver lining. During this time, casts from various films and TV shows <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2496198/great-community-stories-we-learned-from-the-casts-reunion\">have been reuniting</a> to reflect on their projects, entertain folks at home and even raise some money for charity. <em>Frozen star</em> Josh Gad has been a driving force behind this movement, and his latest venture reunited the cast and crew of the hit \u201880s comedy <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1577589/the-splash-role-tom-hanks-initially-auditioned-for\"><em>Splash</em></a>. The latest installment of Josh Gad\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMCd3u3uQ0DtlDfVU0GlKpQ/videos\"><em>Reunited Apart</em></a> series brought together <em>Splash</em>\u2019s Tom Hanks, Darryl Hannah, and Eugene Levy, along with producer Brian Grazer, screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandell and director Ron Howard. During the chat, the group discussed a number of topics, ranging from how <em>Splash</em> was conceived to what it was like to shoot it. For instance, Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah recalled having to learn how to scuba dive in order to shoot underwater scenes. Hannah also revealed that she was nervous during the scenes in which she had to kiss Hanks because she was so young at the time and hadn\u2019t really had a boyfriend. Brian Grazer explained that he came up with the story for Splash before he and Ron Howard collaborated on <em>Night Shift</em>. However, Howard wanted to do the latter before acting on Grazer\u2019s idea. After finishing that film, Grazer floated the idea again, and the two got to work. Although it was great to see the cast and crew share their memories from the film, the sweetest part of the reunion came when Josh Gad invited Ryan Reynolds to close it out with a touching tribute to fellow Canadian and late <em>Splash</em> cast member <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2418762/john-candy-was-a-lot-like-uncle-buck-according-to-his-daughter\">John Candy</a>. You can check out the video in its entirety down below: Josh Gad has done an effective job with getting casts back together, and this latest reunion only adds to his winning streak. He previously rounded up the casts of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495182/watch-the-goonies-cast-reunite-for-a-hilarious-and-nostalgic-zoom-session\"><em>The Goonies</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496030/watch-back-to-the-futures-cast-reunite-for-nostalgic-fun-thanks-to-josh-gad\"><em>Back to the Future</em></a> for some nostalgia-filled conversations. Based on his choices so far, Gad seems to have a particular love of the \u201880s, as many of us do. <em>Splash</em> was released back in 1984, and the movie has become a classic that moviegoers still seek out. It\u2019s most recently found its way onto Disney+, though the streamer was taken to task by fans for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494576/the-best-reactions-to-disneys-butt-censorship-in-tom-hanks-movie-splash\">editing some of its content</a>. Seeing the <em>Splash</em> cast back together and taking the time to honor the memory of the late John Candy is nice to see. Hopefully, Josh Gad can squeeze in a few more of these before everyone is out and about again. If you\u2019re looking to revisit <em>Splash</em>, it\u2019s still available to stream on Disney+. Covering superheroes, sci-fi, comedy, and almost anything else in film and TV. I eat more pizza than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

    "title": "Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling Magically Dispels Some Rumors About Making The Series",
    "content": "<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493979/harry-potter-writer-jk-rowling-suspects-she-had-coronavirus\">J.K. Rowling</a> spent over a decade crafting <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496464/harry-potter-9-strange-things-that-happen-in-the-wizarding-world-we-just-accept\">the world of <em>Harry Potter</em></a>. In the years since it's become a worldwide phenomenon, she's been sharing behind-the-scenes details about the series\u2019 characters as a means of keeping the magic alive. Now, she\u2019s dispelled several popular rumors about how <em>Harry Potter</em> came to be. From Hogwarts history to detailed wizarding family trees, <em>Harry Potter</em> fans love the mythology of the series. We\u2019ve also been equally entranced by the rags to riches story of its author. Over the years, numerous stories about the locations and moments that inspired her to write about the bespectacled wizard have become integral parts of how we view the series\u2019 history, too. Except, now we\u2019re going to have to rethink some of them, because J.K. Rowling herself has set the record straight. It started when <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496369/major-questions-we-still-have-about-the-future-of-harry-potter\">a fan asked</a> the author if she could clarify where the \u201cbirthplace of Harry Potter\u201d is on Twitter: J.K Rowling didn\u2019t stop there, though. In what ultimately became a lengthy Twitter thread, she responded to a slew of other rumors that have cropped up over the years. Fans have long believed that the author began her journey with <em>Harry Potter</em> in a coffee shop in Edinburgh, Scotland called The Elephant House. But it looks like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1263439780987260936\">that\u2019s not true</a>: The author told fans that one of the most common misconceptions is that she based Hogwarts's iconic library on a location in Oporto, Portugal. Then she revealed that the <em>true</em> birthplace of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2496309/harry-potter-reasons-why-jk-rowlings-saga-should-be-turned-into-an-hbo-max-series\"><em>Harry Potter</em></a> -- a location that may be a bit less quaint, but no less humble: Among the other fun <em>Harry Potter</em> facts that J.K. Rowling revealed, she also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1263480048750911492\">cleared up</a> any misconceptions about the inspiration behind Harry Potter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493798/how-harry-potter-fans-can-now-take-hogwarts-classes-during-isolation\">iconic wizarding school</a>: There is <em>one</em> piece of <em>Harry Potter</em> fan lore that J.K. Rowling <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1263481115488202754\">admitted</a> is pretty accurate, though -- she said that she <em>did</em> spend a significant amount of time writing in Nicholsons' Cafe (which, she said, is now a Chinese restaurant). So we\u2019ve had it all (or at least, mostly) wrong about how <em>Harry Potter</em> came into existence. That doesn\u2019t change the amount of effort J.K. Rowling put into bringing the series to life or what an incredible impact it\u2019s had on the world, though.

    "title": "Sounds Like The Cast Of Tenet Was Also Confused By The Film\u2019s Plot",
    "content": "Christopher Nolan\u2019s <em>Tenet</em> is shaping up to be one of the most intriguing films of the year, with many having been impressed by <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546638/tenets-new-trailer-finally-reveals-what-christopher-nolans-movie-is-about\">the film\u2019s trailers</a>. Not much is known about the plot, except that it\u2019ll involve time inversion and, although <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496115/tenets-robert-pattinson-shuts-down-major-theory-about-christopher-nolans-new-movie\">people are speculating</a>, no one seems to have cracked the story. However, fans aren\u2019t alone in trying to decipher what Nolan\u2019s latest tale is about, as the film\u2019s stars even found it tricky to stay on track. Tenet star John David Washington admitted that he always he always had questions for Christopher Nolan while they were shooting the film. Luckily, it sounds like Nolan was more than accommodating when it came to explaining the plot to his cast: Following the latest trailer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDOIFkpjHw4&amp;feature=emb_logo\">release on Fortnite</a>, John David Washington opened up about certain aspects of the movie. This included just <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546766/tenets-star-was-surprised-christopher-nolan-revealed-so-much-information-in-the-new-trailer\">how surprised he was</a> at how much was revealed in the trailer. Still, the new footage didn\u2019t divulge enough for audiences to piece together the actual story. Plot details have been kept firmly under wraps, which is typical when it comes to Christopher Nolan\u2019s projects. Based on the footage we\u2019ve seen so far, we can gather that John David Washington plays an agent tasked with stopping World War III. And during his mission, he learns the inversion of time is crucial to his mission. Christopher Nolan is a cerebral writer/director to say the least, and many of his features leave moviegoers pondering things long after they\u2019ve left the theater. Films like <em>Inception</em> and <em>Interstellar</em> have encouraged us to consider the world we live in and how it relates to us. Meanwhile, <em>The Dark Knight</em> Trilogy Nolan asked fans to consider themes like morality and anarchy. Nolan collaborator Lee Smith, who has served as editor on many of his films, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493081/christopher-nolan-movies-are-complicated-but-theres-a-secret-to-making-them\">has even acknowledged</a> how some viewers can get lost while watching them. This is why he believes his main job is to make the projects as understandable as possible to audiences, all while maintaining Nolan\u2019s vision. With its seemingly complex themes and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546792/christopher-nolans-tenet-trailer-reveals-an-awesome-practical-stunt\">massive set pieces</a>, <em>Tenet</em> will be Christopher Nolan\u2019s most ambitious endeavor to date. Though it\u2019s great to hear that the actors were kept in the loop at all times, which probably aided their performances. Now, we just need to hope that audiences don\u2019t get lost and that our <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495434/tenet-big-questions-we-still-have-about-christopher-nolan-movie\">biggest questions</a> are answered. But for now, let\u2019s just focus on the biggest question we have about the project \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495917/christopher-nolan-still-pushing-for-new-movie-tenet-to-open-theaters-but-its-not-his-choice\">its release date</a>. <em>Tenet</em> is still set to open in theaters on July 17.

    "content": "Steve Carell got his big movie break starring alongside Jim Carrey in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Bruce-Almighty-434.html\"><em>Bruce Almighty</em></a>. While it was undoubtedly an exciting moment in the actor\u2019s career, it also wound up being extremely dangerous. That\u2019s because his character\u2019s big moment originally featured a lot more chaos, including a whole bunch of fire. <em>Bruce Almighty</em> hit theaters in 2003 -- two years before Steve Carell would become a household name thanks to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2484198/steve-carells-idea-to-bring-the-office-characters-back-is-either-genius-or-lunacy\"><em>The Office</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/40-Year-Virgin-Ending-Judd-Apatow-Tells-Us-Why-He-Went-Out-Musical-Note-70898.html\"><em>The 40-Year-Old Virgin</em></a>. So Carell hadn\u2019t fully made a name for himself as an actor, as he was mostly known for his work alongside Jon Stewart on <em>The Daily Show</em>. In the movie, he plays another news anchor, albeit a fictional one -- the obnoxious Evan Baxter. After his character gets the promotion that Bruce was hoping for at their news station, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474215/the-6-best-jim-carrey-movies-and-the-4-worst\">Jim Carrey\u2019s character</a> uses his God-like powers to humiliate him while he\u2019s on air. He takes control of his voice to turn him into a babbling idiot and takes control of the teleprompter and sabotages his news report just to add insult to injury. It\u2019s one of the movie\u2019s most memorable moments, thanks to Steve Carell\u2019s scene-stealing performance. According to the actor, though, there was actually a lot more to the scene that helped make him <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2486416/10-great-serious-performances-from-super-funny-people-including-adam-sandler\">a movie star</a>. An extended version of the scene saw his character going through a <em>lot</em> more: So that sounds like a lot to endure for your first big movie role, especially since <em>Bruce Almighty</em> didn\u2019t rely on CGI to bring Evan Baxter\u2019s horrors to life: The scene in question did make <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMvQ8UstWlg\">its way onto YouTube</a>. It\u2019s very bloody, very fiery, and every bit as dramatic as Steve Carell remembered during his interview on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNH-Xaueg34&amp;feature=emb_logo\"><em>The Graham Norton Show</em></a>: It\u2019s a shame that he went through so much for the scene only for it to wind up on the cutting room floor. At least his character got <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Evan-Almighty-2341.html\">his own spin-off movie</a> -- in the end, that was probably a better deal, even though it meant Evan Baxter, and by proxy Steve Carell, had to suffer even more.

You go to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/amazon\">Amazon Prime</a>, but there are just so many choices. What do you choose?

Whether it's animated movies, action-friendly adventures, or other charming adventures, these are titles for families with all different types of interests. Without further ado, here are a bunch of family films and shows you can enjoy on Amazon Prime now! In <em>Rango</em>, a wayward chameleon winds up in the lowly town of Dirt, a lawless outpost in desperate need of a new sheriff. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Exclusive-Interview-Rango-Director-Gore-Verbinski-23461.html\">Director Gore Verbinski,</a> best known for making the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> trilogy, followed up his Disney blockbusters in an unexpected way. Reuniting with Johnny Depp, he made <em>Rango</em>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Rango-Poster-What-Windup-Goldfish-About-Anyway-22194.html\">an oddball CG-western</a> featuring anamorphic animals, hallucinatory visuals, a dark, existential sense of humor, and copious references to cinematic classics. It should've been a disaster. But in true Verbinski style, this kooky animated flick was a rousing success, providing fresh, vibrant, entertainingly weird family fun \u2014 filled with quirky characters and other goofy touches \u2014 and gave younger viewers one of their first chances to appreciate the long-lost genre. It <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Every-Best-Animated-Feature-Oscar-Winner-Ranked-From-Worst-Best-116287.html\">won an Oscar</a> and provided Verbinski with a rare box office success post-<em>Pirates</em>. <strong>Stream It On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Xv4VN0\">here</a>. Based on E.B. White's novel, <em>Charlotte's Web</em> tells the story of a pig who is saved from slaughter by an intelligent spider who writes messages in her webs. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> With its simple, yet universally appealing, story, spirited voice performances, warmly-crafted visuals, and its big, beating heart, <em>Charlotte's Web</em> is an absolute charmer, filled with sweetness and compassion, and its winsome storytelling makes it an easy film to love. Its delicate, timeless tale of friendship and care resonates with viewers of all-ages, and its enjoyable music numbers, tender emotional beats, and winsome hand-drawn animation make for a lovely, heartwarming viewing experience. It's a respectful and admirable adaptation of E.B. White's beloved book. There's a good reason why it continues to connect with audiences of all ages. Be sure to have a few tissues on hand, though. <strong>Stream It On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bY4H6p\">here.</a> Based on the 2012 documentary <em>The Wrestlers: Fighting With My Family</em>, this comedy-drama biopic dramatized the early days of Paige as she made her way into the WWE. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> Though it's slightly more adult and crass than some other titles on this list, notably with a <strong>PG-13</strong> rating, <em>Fighting With My Family</em> is an enjoyable, rousing, inspiring family-style comedy about finding your style, making your impact, and proving your stuff \u2014while also imparting a loving message about the importance of family and staying true to the people you love, even when you're thousands of miles away. Featuring excellent performances from Florence Pugh, Nick Frost, and Jack Lowden, along with a surprising turn from Vince Vaughn, this sports comedy proudly features the sharp wit and heart of writer/director Stephen Merchant. <strong>Stream It On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Xv9sPw\">here</a>. <strong>Also Consider:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gkSvjK\"><em>Instant Family</em></a> (2018) - (also rated PG-13) Based on a series of children's books by Gabrielle Vincent, <em>Ernest &amp; Celestine</em> is the tale of an unlikely friendship between a bear and a young mouse. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> There are very few animated kids movies more sweet and emotionally satisfying than <em>Ernest &amp; Celestine.</em> The adorably gentle, old-fashioned family film, made in the style of hand-drawn watercolor animation, is a bright, sensitive, enjoyably off-beat charmer, filled with warm characters, gorgeous designs, hilarious sight gags, and a beautiful simplicity which radiates in every vivid frame. While it is slower and more carefree than a few other contemporary animated movies, it doesn't take long before you're wrapped up in its pleasant pace. It's like a picture book come to life, one made even livelier by its winning vocal performances. It's an absolute treasure of a film. <strong>Stream It On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TS4o7d\">here.</a> Based on the beloved graphic novels by Herg\u00e9, <em>The Adventures of Tintin</em> follows our title character as he goes treasure hunting with Captain Haddock. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> There aren't many filmmakers out there who can capture the wonder, thrills, and excitement of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495180/what-to-watch-on-amazon-prime-if-you-like-action\">action-adventure genre</a> like Steven Spielberg can. The acclaimed director is known worldwide for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496246/steven-spielberg-movies-available-for-streaming-right-now\">everything from prestige period dramas to futuristic sci-fi thrillers</a>, but he is often at his best when he's making an exhilarating action romp. The <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2490898/steven-spielberg-wont-direct-indiana-jones-5-after-all\"><em>Indiana Jones</em> movies</a> proved that handily, though if those movies a little too intense for younger audiences, you can introduce them to the majesty of Spielberg with the charming, entertaining animated movie, <em>The Adventures of Tintin</em>. This 2011 blockbuster features lovable characters, exotic locations, rousing performances, and cutting-edge motion-capture special effects. It's a fun ride. <strong>Stream It On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3egE1iN\">here</a>. <em>Harriet the Spy</em> is a coming-of-age story about a girl who aspires to be a writer and spy. Based on the novel of the same name by Louise Fitzhugh. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> Oftentimes, the best children's movies are the ones that respect the earnest, precious perspectives of their young audiences. The ones that don't talk down to them, or rely solely on cheap bathroom humor to win them over. Indeed, <em>Harriet the Spy</em> is a good example of a family film that's certainly commendable when it comes to its well-realized characters, strong performances, impressively confident direction from its first-time feature filmmaker, and sharp performances, notably from newcomer Michelle Trachtenberg and Rosie O'Donnell, but what stands out the most is the intuitive, nuanced lens through which it reflects the curious, intelligent, introspective mind of its wannabe sleuth. <strong>Stream It On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ejYx1U\">here.</a> In <em>The Kid</em>, Charlie Chaplin's first feature-length film, The Tramp takes care of an abandoned child, but events put their father-son dynamic in jeopardy. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> The timeless quality of a great silent film is certainly a wonder to behold. And few filmmakers capture the radiant wonder of cinema quite like Charlie Chaplin. As an actor and director, he was an exceptionally precise, dutifully hard-working entertainer, but there is an almost effortless charm to his greatest work, allowing the laughs to come handily and the emotions to come easily. Certainly, one of The Tramp's biggest triumphs came with 1921's <em>The Kid.</em> In his first feature-length film, Chaplin assumed a paternal role, allowing his famous on-screen persona to grow and develop in heartfelt, yet still hilarious, new ways, resulting in one of his most engaging, emotional movies. <strong>Stream It On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eg6c1l\">here</a>. When two parents announce their separation, their kids lock them in the basement until they sort things out. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> Though it hasn't received the same universal praise or recognition as some other titles on this list, <em>House Arrest</em> rocks a stellar cast, a fun premise, outlandish antics, and cheeky humor for children and adults alike. Starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Pollak, Jennifer Tilly, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Wallace Shawn, and more, it's a stacked deck of recognizable actors \u2014 a <em>full house</em>, if you will \u2014 in a rambunctious, kid-friendly romp. Indeed, this type of well-cast family flick with a broad premise isn't seen too often nowadays, nearly making it a product of its time, but you can watch it with your family now on Amazon Prime. <strong>Stream It On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZBeM6W\">here.</a> <strong>Also Consider:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TBugUy\"><em>Yours, Mine and Ours</em></a> (2005), <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3egWfRd\"><em>Troop Zero</em></a> (2020), <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2B04MtC\"><em>It Takes Two</em></a> (1995) Based on the novel by Brian Selznick, <em>Wonderstruck</em> interlaces two stories set fifty years apart, one focused on a young deaf girl in 1927 and the other centered around a recently-deaf young boy in 1977, and their quests to find their lost parents. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> While Todd Haynes is known for his more adult fare, the <em>Velvet Goldmine</em> director made a rare departure into family-friendly territory with <em>Wonderstruck</em>, a poetic, spellbinding movie which was sorely overlooked upon release. Using his vivid imagery and wonderful sense of time and place to capture the, ahem, wondrous perspectives of our young protagonists, <em>Wonderstruck</em> is as narratively impressive and dynamically stylistic as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485845/why-whistleblower-movies-like-dark-waters-make-for-good-cinema\">every other Haynes film yet</a>, though this one in particular can be enjoyed and appreciated by audiences both young and old. It's a wonderful time. <strong>Stream It On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Xlh2MA\">here.</a> The beloved PBS children's show explores everyday topics and the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, presented through its genial host, Fred Rogers. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> It's always <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485882/how-the-real-life-journalist-in-a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-feels-about-the-movie\">a beautiful day in the neighborhood</a> when you invite Fred Rogers into your home. Indeed, several seasons of Rogers' beloved, celebrated children's show, <em>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</em>, are only a click away thanks to Amazon Prime. What better time is there to watch and enjoy this wonderful program? No matter what age you are, Rogers' endearing, elegant discussions of several real-life topics \u2014 each one told in a firm, refreshingly straightforward but always calm and smoothing way \u2014 are both a balm and a rich delight, especially in an uncertain and often scary world. He always brings a warm smile to your face, and that's a good feeling. <strong>Stream It On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gkCsSK\">here.</a> <strong>Also Consider:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3d2grGj\"><em>SpongeBob SquarePants</em></a> (1999 - Present) Based on E.B.

White adaptation, <em>Stuart Little</em> is a charming, winning family film, notably with impressive visual effects, clever gags, and a great vocal performance from Michael J. Fox. In addition to its delightful predecessor, Amazon also currently carries its sequel, <em>Stuart Little 2</em>, which is not only as good as the first but <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Stuart-Little-2-401.html\">arguably better.</a> The story is closer to the book, the stakes are higher, the emotional beats are stronger, and it contains all the wit and heart of the original film. <strong>Stream Stuart Little On Amazon Prime</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2X2RLYW\">here</a> <strong>and Stuart Little 2</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3giUmFz\">here.</a> Based on the novel by Walter Farley, <em>The Black Stallion</em> tells the story of a young man who is shipwrecked on a deserted island with a wild stallion. <strong>Why It's A Good Option For The Whole Family:</strong> There are several family movies out there centered around kids befriending animals or creatures \u2014 whether it's dogs, cats, pigs, whales, dolphins, you name it.

    "title": "Why George Lucas Had Doubts About Introducing Yoda In Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back",
    "content": "It\u2019s pretty impossible to imagine the <em>Star Wars</em> universe without Yoda in it. He wasn\u2019t introduced until <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495852/taika-waititi-reveals-his-favorite-empire-strikes-back-line-and-why-it-resonates\"><em>The Empire Strikes Back</em></a>, but he\u2019s become such an iconic part of the franchise that even people who aren\u2019t fans know his name. George Lucas had <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546745/george-lucas-doesnt-know-why-star-wars-fans-love-star-wars-but-takes-a-guess-at-why-it-works\">no idea</a> the Jedi master would become such a big deal, though -- and it turns out he actually had serious doubts about introducing him into the films at all. The <em>Star Wars</em> director\u2019s dubiousness about Yoda came from a logical place. It\u2019s not that he didn\u2019t like the character or didn\u2019t see his value. It was just that there were so many moving parts on the <em>Empire Strikes Back</em> set that he had no idea what to expect when he began filming with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462162/original-yoda-puppeteer-really-hated-his-star-wars-episode-i-appearance\">the puppet</a>: It\u2019s easy to see how that would be stressful. George Lucas recalled to <a href=\"https://www.starwars.com/news/empire-at-40-george-lucas-interview\">StarWars.com</a> that he had a lot of expectations riding on his shoulders as he was making <em>The Empire Strikes Back,</em> so introducing an element he wasn\u2019t sure of had to require a huge leap of faith: To be completely fair, he definitely didn\u2019t have as much success with some of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2454556/simon-pegg-regrets-hating-on-star-wars-jar-jar-binks\">the other characters</a> he introduced later on in the film series. It <em>is</em> hard to guess what fans will connect with and what they\u2019ll dislike, and the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise has faced <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496238/star-wars-icon-mark-hamill-responds-to-contentious-fandom-and-rise-of-skywalker-backlash\">that challenge</a> time and time again, with mixed results. Still, there\u2019s no denying the fact that Frank Oz, Stuart Freeborn and George Lucas created something truly magical with Yoda. For being such a small creature, he\u2019s cast a long shadow on the franchise, to the point that <em>The Mandalorian</em>'s The Child (which has been given his name) was the catalyst for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2487456/the-mandalorians-pedro-pascal-shared-a-perfect-baby-yoda-cocktail-for-the-holidays\">huge viral moments</a> last year. <em>Star Wars</em> fans have grown to love Yoda in all his forms, so it\u2019s a good thing George Lucas trusted the process and took the risk to introduce him to the world.

    "content": "<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496030/watch-back-to-the-futures-cast-reunite-for-nostalgic-fun-thanks-to-josh-gad\"><em>Back to the Future</em></a> is a timeless (no pun intended) film trilogy that many moviegoers have a soft spot for. As such, some fans probably weren\u2019t too happy when Netflix released a version of <em>Back to the Future Part II</em> that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546698/looks-like-netflix-edited-back-to-the-futures-adult-content\">censored a scene</a> in the film. The <em>Back to the Future Part II</em> scene, in question, is the sequence in which Marty McFly attempts to snatch the sports almanac from Principal Strickland\u2019s office. And as you might remember, when he does grab the book, he finds that it\u2019s only Biff\u2019s dirty magazine. In the Netflix version, the magazine cover is poorly edited out. Fans were quick to notice the change and point it out on social media. Now, it would appear that franchise scribe Bob Gale also had a problem with this altered version and has even gone as far as to tell Universal Pictures to dispose of it. Bob Gale explained that both he and director Robert Zemeckis had no idea this version of the film existed. According to the writer, it was made because a country took issue with the magazine cover. Because Gale couldn\u2019t (and doesn\u2019t) blame Netflix for this cut of the movie, he went to Universal to make his feelings known: During his conversation with <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/back-future-writer-says-dont-blame-netflix-censored-version-sequel-1295639\">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Gale stressed that Netflix was not to blame for this version being released. He also sounds relieved that the original cut of the film is now running on the streaming service: Censoring films has been a common practice in the entertainment industry, but one could argue that it\u2019s only increased with the rise of streaming services. Disney+ has been <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494672/aladdin-the-lion-king-and-7-other-movies-disney-has-already-censored\">particularly active</a> when it comes to this practice. The streamer has already made changes to several films in its library, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493332/yes-disney-apparently-edited-a-lilo-and-stitch-scene-and-fans-are-freaking\"><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em></a> to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494374/looks-like-disney-cut-some-nudity-out-of-tom-hanks-splash\"><em>Splash</em></a>. While some edits can be helpful, others can sometimes hinder the experience for the viewer, and that seems to have been how Bob Gale felt about the change to <em>Back to the Future Part II</em>. It may be disappointing that it happened in the first place but, on the bright side, Universal seems to have been swift in rectifying its decision. <em>The Back to the Future</em> trilogy is now available to stream on Netflix. Covering superheroes, sci-fi, comedy, and almost anything else in film and TV. I eat more pizza than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

    "content": "There\u2019s been pressure for years for Zack Snyder to get his chance to release his cut of <em>Justice League</em>. Now that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496562/release-the-snyder-cut-zack-snyders-justice-league-going-to-hbo-max\">he finally has the opportunity</a>, though, he\u2019s got a new set of challenges to contend with. At least, that\u2019s what Jason Blum thinks -- and he has some interesting things to say about what those challenges could be. The <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493273/why-jason-blum-believes-movie-business-will-look-different-following-coronavirus\">founder of Blumhouse Productions</a> knows a thing or two about what happens behind the scenes. He recently spoke about the factors that directors deal with when they\u2019re trying to bring their movies to the screen: On that note, while speaking with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=401&amp;v=Uogq-LSMRPE&amp;feature=emb_title\">Fox 5 DC</a> reporter (and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/podcasts/reelblend/\">ReelBlend</a> podcast co-host) Kevin McCarthy, Jason Blum also shared his on how important it is for filmmakers to be able to do their jobs without a lot of outside influence or noise: Jason Blum also offered some perspective on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546656/the-snyder-cut-release-should-not-set-a-new-precedent-in-hollywood\">the potential downside</a> of fan-driven movements like #ReleaseTheSnyderCut: The point that Jason Blum seems to be making is that the very people who are there to support filmmakers can also make it harder for them to do their jobs. Zack Snyder\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496356/zack-snyder-reportedly-screened-his-snyder-cut-of-justice-league-what-does-that-mean\">vision for <em>Justice League</em></a> has already been subject to the influence of producers and executives. The question is whether he will be able to stay focused on his vision, as he finally gets a chance to finish his version of the film. There\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546724/zack-snyders-thank-you-for-the-snyder-cut-involves-an-airplane\">no question</a> that fans helped make it possible for him to do that -- but it\u2019s also fair to say he still deserves to release the Snyder Cut on his own terms.

Did they not see how much Taron <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478961/rocketmans-taron-egerton-spent-a-ton-of-time-learning-piano\">gave to that role?</a> He was robbed of his moment to shine at the Oscars, but his supporting cast also deserved more recognition as well. <em>Rocketman</em>\u2019s supporting cast includes Jamie Bell (also really needed a best supporting nomination), Bryce Dallas Howard, and Richard Madden. Even if the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2488340/the-biggest-snubs-from-the-2020-oscar-nominations\">Academy decided to snub</a> <em>Rocketman</em> and the cast in most of the major categories, it doesn\u2019t take away from <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478693/rocketman-and-7-other-summer-movies-that-were-surprise-successes-for-hollywood\">the film\u2019s success</a> and brilliance. Most of <em>Rocketman</em>\u2019s cast are accomplished and rising stars with pretty impressive current and future role credits. They will continue to build their resumes with entertaining, thought provoking, and award deserving roles. In <em>Rocketman,</em> Taron Egerton plays the lead role of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474293/rocketman-big-differences-between-the-movie-and-elton-johns-real-life\">musical legend Elton John</a>. It\u2019s really a film that relies heavily on Egerton\u2019s performance to carry it through, and he more than succeeds. After <em>Rocketman</em>, he voiced a character named Rian in <em>The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance</em>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2478625/the-dark-crystal-age-of-resistance-creators-explain-huge-challenges-to-making-a-puppet-series-on-netflix\">the continuation series</a> of Jim Henson\u2019s classic.

Bell co-stars alongside Michael B. Jordan, Jodie Turner-Smith, and Luke Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2480634/without-remorse\">in <em>Without Remorse</em>,</a> an adaptation of Tom Clancy\u2019s novel of the same name. It\u2019s about a U.S Navy SEAL who seeks vengeance after his girlfriend is murdered. The film is scheduled for an October 2, 2020 release. Jamie Bell voices the character of Danny in the animated film <em>Cranston Academy: Monster Zone</em>. The film is about a 15 year old who accidentally opens a portal with monsters from another dimension. <em>Cranston Academy: Monster Zone</em> was released in Portugal in March 2020. Well known for playing Robb Stark on HBO's <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Richard Madden plays Elton\u2019s former lover and manager John Reid in <em>Rocketman</em>. He\u2019s essentially the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475056/rocketman-villain-john-reid-is-in-bohemian-rhapsody-too-heres-the-full-story\">movie\u2019s biggest villain</a>, besides Elton\u2019s parents of course.

It\u2019s a series of six stories about finding your soulmate, and the lengths people go to to love and be loved.

Tom Bennett appeared in episodes of <em>Thanks for the Memories, Red Dwarf,</em> and <em>After Life.</em> He only appeared in one episode of <em>After Life,</em> which is the Ricky Gervais Netflix comedy. Charlie Rowe plays Elton and Bernie\u2019s first music producer. He introduced Bernie and Elton. Charlie Rowe appears in the upcoming Peacock min-series <em>Angelyne</em>.

The film is so memorable because of the big explosive conclusion. <em><strong>Ready or Not</strong></em> <strong>spoilers ahead: Turn back now if you haven\u2019t seen the ending yet.</strong> After Grace spends most of the night evading her new in-laws, they finally manage to catch her and get her held down on a table, ready to be sacrificed. And then her new husband's brother Daniel (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478748/adam-brody-had-no-idea-what-was-going-on-during-his-shazam-audition\">Adam Brody</a>) poisons his family to help Grace escape. As he tells her that he plans to free Alex (Mark O\u2019Brien), so they can leave together, Daniel\u2019s wife Charity (Elyse Levesque) appears pointing a gun at Grace. Daniel steps in between them, so Charity shoots him--giving Daniel a fatal wound. Grace manages to disarm Charity and knock her out. Meanwhile, Alex breaks free and heads to find Grace. Grace gets trapped in a room with Alex\u2019s mother Becky (Andie MacDowell). The two women fight but Grace gets the upper hand. She then bashes Becky\u2019s face in, and Alex sees it. He tries to reach out to Grace, but she recoils away. In that moment, he realizes that there is no turning back for them. Their marriage is over. He then grabs her and calls for his family to start up the ritual. The family holds Grace down and Alex is about to put a dagger through her heart, but she moves away at the last second. Aunt Helene (Nicky Guadagni) then shows that the sun has risen. They have not fulfilled their duties to Mr. Le Bail. They wait for a moment, unsure of what's about to happen to them. All they knew was that, if the Hide and Seek card gets drawn, the newly added member to the family must be killed before the sun rises or something bad will happen to the whole family. After a few minutes of nothing happening, they believe that maybe it was just a hoax. Then Aunt Helene explodes as she tries to kill Grace. One by one they all start to explode as Grace watches and laughs. Alex is the last one. He tries to beg Grace to take him back, and says that he was spared because he\u2019s not like them, and she\u2019s the reason that he gets another chance. Grace then tells him that she wants a divorce and takes off the ring. The moment she throws it at him, Alex explodes. Grace leaves as the house burns down. Then sits on the mansion porch, in a bloody dress, smoking a cigarette, and an authority figure (police officer, EMT, or firefighter) asks her what happened here?

Cinemablend spoke to the film\u2019s directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett about the original plans for the <em>Ready or Not</em> finale. It ended a lot darker and less fun. Originally, Alex was supposed to succeed in putting the dagger through Grace\u2019s heart and the Le Domas family would be spared and free to continue their legacy. Matt Bettinelli-Olpin had this to say <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482842/the-amazing-way-ready-or-nots-brilliant-ending-came-together\">about the original ending</a>: The film directors also <a href=\"https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a29207102/ready-or-not-ending-explained-alternate-version/\">told DigitalSpy that</a> after the Le Domas family killed Grace there was supposed to be a scene where they join a bunch of other rich families who also owe their riches to Mr. Le Bail. Before we get into possible futures for Grace, let\u2019s examine why Mr. Le Bail spared her life. Technically Grace became part of the Le Domas family the minute she married Alex, but she was the only one in the house to not explode. I have two theories on why Grace didn\u2019t die with the rest of them. The first is that Grace never officially joined the family. Legally, she married Alex, but <em>Ready or Not</em> specifically states that Grace wouldn\u2019t become part of the family until they play the game. Also, at the beginning of the movie, many of the Le Domas family members state that Grace doesn\u2019t belong. She\u2019s not one of them. I don't think this has anything to do with class, because both Charity and Becky implied that they didn\u2019t come from wealthy families either. It more has to do with Grace\u2019s character. I think the reason Mr. Le Bail chose Hide-And-Seek for Grace is because she didn\u2019t belong. The other new members got easy games. The only other one to draw Hide-And-Seek was Charlies (Andrew Anthony), Helene\u2019s dead husband, and for all we know, he could have been a saint. My second theory is that Grace didn\u2019t die because she won the game. During the scene where Tony (Henry Czerny) explains to Grace their family\u2019s history with Mr. Le Bail, he says that his great grandfather inherited Le Bail\u2019s good fortune when he solved the box and won the game. I think that once Grace won the game, she was a recipient of Mr. Le Bail\u2019s fortune and curse. It would explain the nod we see him give her when he briefly appears in his chair. I also believe that\u2019s why Alex didn\u2019t explode until she took the ring off. When you marry someone, you become your own new family unit. Alex existed in that moment as part of the Le Domas family, and also as part of his family with Grace. Once she removed the ring, she broke their bond, and he was no longer part of her family. He was a full original Le Domas, and therefore eligible to die. So... does Grace inherit the Le Domas fortune? Well, she was legally married to Alex when she died, and the only surviving member of that division. Grace could make up any story and the police have no evidence against her claims. This might spare her from any suspicion in their murder. Grace seemed most excited about having a family, not the fortune with it Maybe she wouldn't want anything to do with the money. Of course, she use it for charities or to start a business, but it seems unlikely she'd become a spoiled rich heiress. There are no confirmed plans for <em>Ready or Not</em> sequels, but the directors <a href=\"https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3579928/radio-silence-talk-sequel-possibilities-ready-not-spoilers/\">told Bloody Disgusting</a> some of the potential ideas <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479154/why-ready-or-not-needs-a-bloody-sequel\">for a sequel.</a> They joked about a Fitch (Kristian Brunn) and Emilie (Melanie Scrofano) prequel, and I would love to watch any Le Domas family prequel. <em>Ready or Not</em> had a lot of little moments of details about their pasts that could lead to really interesting prequels. For example, Charity and Daniel\u2019s whole dynamic could work as a horror movie. Charity talked about a past so terrible that she would rather die than go back to it. Daniel and her had such a volatile dynamic, but Charity seemed genuinely hurt by Daniel\u2019s lack of caring about her dying--which seems to imply they did love each other at some point. So what happened? Also everything in me wanted Alex to not be terrible, so I wouldn\u2019t mind seeing a prequel about him and Grace. Aunt Helene talked about him possibly being the chosen one. I would like to learn more about that--maybe see him fighting the call of darkness in a prequel. Follow-up story sequels could also work. The Le Domas family mentioned other families, including other members of their own, who suffered because they didn\u2019t play by the rules. We could see more families burdened by Le Bail\u2019s curse, and how that manifests for them. Le Domas had to play games because that\u2019s how they made their fortune, but how would it work for a family who became rich from horse racing? Or tech? Also now that Grace survived, and is possibly rich, what might happen in a sequel for her? Is she now on a quest to infiltrate other rich families and beat them? What happens if Grace marries again? Does Mr. Le Bail now demand payment from her? We have a lot of lingering questions pertaining to Grace that could be potential compelling horror sequels. <em>Ready or Not</em> has created such a rich story, that there are so many possibilities for potential future stories of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492570/ready-or-not-and-6-other-under-the-radar-horror-gems\">this horror gem.</a> If you want to relive the Le Domas family slaughter again, <em>Ready or Not</em> <a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/whats-new-whats-leaving\">will be available</a> on HBO Now and HBO Go on May 23.

    "title": "Suicide Squad Director Explains Why The Ayer Cut Probably Won\u2019t Happen",
    "content": "DC fans are just coming off the unprecedented news that the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut movement will end with a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496562/release-the-snyder-cut-zack-snyders-justice-league-going-to-hbo-max\">director\u2019s cut of <em>Justice League</em> for HBO Max</a>. But as one campaign gets some closure, another DCEU movie has been thrown into the spotlight again. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546756/suicide-squad-and-6-other-movies-that-deserve-the-snyder-cut-treatment\">What about David Ayer\u2019s <em>Suicide Squad</em></a>? Here\u2019s what the filmmaker has to say: Following the harsh reviews the 2016 film received, Ayer has revealed that his true vision for the film was compromised by studio meddling. Not unlike Zack Snyder, the filmmaker has posted various tidbits from his intended version of the movie on social media throughout the years. David Ayer has made various claims about his original film, such as their being sequences with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495713/why-suicide-squad-directors-heart-breaks-for-jared-leto\">Jared Leto\u2019s Joker</a> that have not been seen and that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494298/why-suicide-squad-director-david-ayer-says-harley-quinns-story-arc-was-eviscerated\">Harley Quinn\u2019s story arc was \u201ceviscerated\u201d</a> from the film, among other things. Fans are already using the hashtag #ReleaseTheAyerCut now that the Snyder Cut is getting a happy ending. Quickly following the news, Ayer took the the platform to post a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546631/suicide-squad-director-posts-cryptic-joker-message-after-snyder-cut-is-announced?pv=related_list\">series of cryptic posts</a> to seemingly turn attention over to <em>Suicide Squad</em>. His recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidAyerMovies/status/1263553371476078592\">comments on Twitter</a> shows his support for Warner Bros as the studio gears up for James Gunn\u2019s <em>The Suicide Squad</em> in 2021. Ayer explained that it would be \u201cjust fine\u201d with him if the Ayer Cut of <em>Suicide Squad</em> remains a rumor. But on the other hand, he doesn\u2019t outright say he wouldn\u2019t like it to exist. In fact, one fan reached out to the AT&amp;T Twitter account (the company owns Warner Bros) to ask for the Ayer Cut. Here\u2019s what happened: The filmmaker also took to Twitter to respond to a fan asking for a re-release of <em>Suicide Squad</em> with this statement: So is David Ayer A-ok with his <em>Suicide Squad</em> never seeing the light of day or not? <em>Suicide Squad</em> is a bit of a different story than <em>Justice League</em> was. David Ayer was the director from start to finish on the comic book film, and it made a good margin of profit for itself ($746 million against a budget of $175 million), despite its bummer reviews. <em>Justice League</em>, on the other hand, was a significant loss for Warner Bros., making $657 million worldwide on a reported production budget of $300 million. Snyder hurriedly left his vision behind when he suffered the sudden loss of his teen daughter, leaving Joss Whedon in charge and some serious last-minute changes to the superhero, team-up film. Overall, there\u2019s a bit more to gain from the Snyder Cut, since its plans have clearly been abandoned since. When it comes to <em>Suicide Squad</em>, the studio already has its own game plan to rewrite the wrongs of the franchise with James Gunn\u2019s version. But if the fan following grows, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546656/the-snyder-cut-release-should-not-set-a-new-precedent-in-hollywood\">could history repeat itself</a>?

    "title": "Why Adam Sandler's Movies Are So Great To Work On, According To The Wrong Missy Star",
    "content": "Adam Sandler has been in the film industry for decades now, and many know that he has a very \u201cspecific\u201d style of filmmaking. Over the years, fans and critics have had polarized thoughts on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495194/adam-sandler-movies-available-streaming-right-now\">Sandler\u2019s filmography</a>, leading to a debate on the merits of his work. Despite this, many find his films to be relatively harmless fun, and it sounds like the process of making the films is just as enjoyable. Lauren Lapkus recently starred in Netflix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496587/david-spade-thanks-fans-after-new-netflix-film-the-wrong-missy-hits-1\"><em>The Wrong Missy</em></a>, which was produced by Adam Sandler\u2019s production company, Happy Madison Productions. Although it was only her first time working on a Sandler production, Lapkus says that she was quickly embraced by the cast and crew, who are like an extended family. She believes this stems from the fact that most of the Happy Madison crew have been working together for a few decades: Lauren Lapkus\u2019 sentiments to <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2020/05/07/how-netflixs-wrong-missy-brought-lauren-lapkus-into-the-adam-sandler-film-family/\">Los Angeles Daily News</a> aren\u2019t unfounded. Say what you will about Adam Sandler and his work, the veteran actor does keep his collaborators close. When it comes to directors, Sandler has established a core group that include filmmakers like <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/dvds/1482339/Benchwarmers\"><em>The Benchwarmers</em></a> and <em>I Now Pronounce You Chuck</em> and Larry\u2019s Dennis Dugan and Frank Coraci, who helmed <em>Click</em>, <em>Zookeeper</em> and <em>Blended</em>. This also applies to the actors Sandler works with in front of the camera. Most know by now that he\u2019s had multiple collaborations with actors like Kevin James, Rob Schneider and Jon Lovitz, some of whom are colleagues from Sandler\u2019s Saturday Night Live days. Schneider and two of Sandler\u2019s close colleagues, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496435/why-netflixs-the-wrong-missy-was-tricky-for-david-spade-to-film\">David Spade</a> and Nick Swardson, actually star in <em>The Wrong Missy</em> alongside Lauren Lapkus. When it comes to his movies, Adam Sandler is quite self-aware about what they are and how people perceive them. That doesn\u2019t mean the comedian doesn\u2019t stand by his work, though, as he\u2019s stated that he has never phoned in a single role. This is probably why characters like Billy Madison and Bobby Boucher have earned so many fans -- including Ariana Grande, who has even <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494127/ariana-grande-went-full-waterboy-during-isolation-and-adam-sandler-approves\">parodied scenes</a> from <em>The Waterboy</em>. Lauren Lapkus\u2019 comments about working with Happy Madison are nice to hear, as it\u2019s usually to anyone\u2019s benefit to be working in a warm work environment. Not only does it make people more comfortable, but it arguably allows work to be performed at a high-quality rate. <em>The Wrong Missy</em> is now streaming on Netflix. Covering superheroes, sci-fi, comedy, and almost anything else in film and TV. I eat more pizza than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

    "title": "Avengers: Endgame Concept Art Reveals Wild Alternate Design For The Time Travel Suits",
    "content": "Fans are always excited to see what kinds of costumes the Avengers will sport in their latest films, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496166/avengers-endgames-poster-was-remade-with-retro-comic-images-and-i-cant-look-away\"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a> managed to give all of the original heroes new looks. However, aside from their typical attire, Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes and their allies also donned <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2461034/kevin-feige-addresses-the-quantum-realms-role-in-the-mcu\">quantum realm</a> suits, which they used to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477366/even-the-avengers-endgame-writers-admit-time-travel-is-ludicrous\">travel through time</a>. While the final designs for the costumes were well done, concept art has now revealed that the gear could\u2019ve looked a lot different. Aleksi Briclot, an artist and illustrator whose worked on several Marvel films, shared an early sketch of Captain America sporting a quantum realm suit. Only this suit is gold and is a lot bulkier than what we saw in the film. You can check out the alternate design for yourself: At first glance, that suit doesn\u2019t even look like it was meant for time travel. Instead, it looks like it would be more suited for scuba diving. The gear also has key similarities to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2486697/9-iron-man-suits-from-the-comics-we-wish-made-it-into-the-movies\">an Iron Man suit</a>, especially due to its armor-like build. From a storytelling perspective, the Russos and the screenwriters could have made this an intentional connection, since Tony Stark was one of the driving forces behind the team\u2019s time travel efforts. Nevertheless, it was probably best that directors Joe and Anthony Russo opted for the quantum realm suits that were featured in the movie. First off, the final design is a lot sleeker and very functional, which the heroes needed while traversing through different time periods. It would have taken time for them to move around in the others, and getting them off would have taken time away from their mission. Bringing this design to life may have also required the use of more practical effects. One of the amazing things about the costumes seen on screen is that they were <a href=\"https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/avengers-endgame-movie-quantum-realm-suits-vfx-marvel/\">created entirely with visual effects</a>. No part of the suits were done practically, which likely saved time. While it may not have been impossible to do so with this original concept, the creatives may have wanted to incorporate some level of practicality with it, which could have been time-consuming and costly. Finally, the suits in the film are very similar to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470461/that-time-paul-rudd-asked-people-to-punch-him-in-the-ant-man-suit-to-scratch-an-itch\">the Ant-Man suit</a> cosmetically, which makes complete sense. Although Tony Stark discovered the trick to time travel, it was Hank Pym\u2019s eponymous Particles that made traveling possible. And with the team all using the particles, it would make sense that they\u2019d have suits that are designed to handle their physiological capabilities. The suit that appears in Aleksi Briclot\u2019s concept art is definitely interesting and would\u2019ve been intriguing to see on the big screen. Still, fans didn\u2019t seem to have any complaints about what the attire that the characters ultimately ended up wearing. The final designs, admittedly, weren\u2019t as elaborate as this one, but they still got the job done, in more ways than one. <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> is now available to stream on Disney+.

    "title": "Wolverine And 9 Other Mutants Who Could Have A Huge Impact On The MCU",
    "content": "The X-Men are coming to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though we still have little idea regarding which heroes will appear or how Marvel Studios will make this happen. Will we get all new versions of the heroes we've previously seen on screen across the board, or will they be a mixture of past and present? What about new mutants; will they be the future of the franchise? I don't have the answers, but I do have a list of characters I think could impact the MCU in major and positive ways; some simply by their presence, others by how their arrival could impact or influence the lives of other characters within the superhero franchise. And then there are some I just felt were done dirty by the past couple decades of representation, so let's run down all of that and hope these heroes make it into the MCU. Fans know and love him, and they'll probably start a small riot the minute someone other than Hugh Jackman portrays him. Regardless it's hard to imagine the MCU introducing the mutants without Wolverine, and it will be quite the treat to see how he's handled under Marvel Studios. Honestly, I'm not sure whoever takes the role needs to do much more than what Jackman did, though I would like to see the old yellow and black costume make an appearance. Bobby Drake is one of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479486/6-x-men-the-fox-franchise-didnt-do-justice\">most powerful mutants</a> the <em>X-Men</em> mythos has to offer, though you wouldn't know it from the character's outings in the movies. Iceman deserves to be shown as the massive force of nature that he is, and not the reverse Human Torch he came off as in the Fox movies. My hope is that Marvel Studios will show the more creative things Iceman can do with his powers like exponentially increasing his size by pulling moisture from the air. When it comes to complex villains of the Marvel Universe, it rarely gets better than Magneto. A mutant shaped by his experience in the Holocaust, Magneto came out on the other side of it never wishing to see his kind face mass persecution again. He fights for mutants, but many of his actions are detrimental to humans. I fear the MCU got ahold of the character a little too late to reasonably portray the Holocaust as part of his story, but perhaps those in charge can figure it out with their creative minds to keep his story and motivations as complex as they've been throughout the years. With so much of the past two decades of <em>X-Men</em> movies featuring Charles Xavier at the head of the X-Men, perhaps it's time for a change of leadership. If that's the case, who better to bring in as a new leader for the X-Men than Kitty Pryde? Pryde has a long history as leader of the X-Men in Marvel Comics, and with all due respect to Xavier, is more of a hands on leader that would better lend herself to the action of the MCU. There's no denying that Deadpool would majorly shake up the MCU, so much so that fans are still wondering <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495525/how-ryan-reynolds-feels-about-disney-now-being-in-control-of-deadpool\">how Marvel would introduce</a> the R-rated Merc with the Mouth into its world. The MCU can be risqu\u00e9 and action-packed, but it's rarely vulgar and gruesome. Still, just because it may be hard to pull off doesn't mean Marvel Studios should <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495990/deadpool-creator-blames-marvel-for-deadpool-3s-delay-ryan-reynolds\">balk at the opportunity</a> to incorporate him. There are plenty of fans who want to see Ryan Reynolds' hero interact with the heroes of the MCU, and they'll certainly pack a theater to see how it'll play out. Another X-Men that was done dirty by the Fox movies, Psylocke is a relatively popular mutant who never truly got her comeuppance. The MCU could use Psylocke as a means of introducing more foreign heroes into the universe, as she's the sister to one of Europe's greatest heroes, Captain Britain. Plus, her mastery of telekinetic weaponry would be a nice change of pace to the usual telekinetic abilities X-Men has highlighted way too much via Jean Grey. I'm not saying we need to forget about Jean Grey, but I will absolutely not sit through another adaptation of <em>The Dark Phoenix Saga</em>, even in the MCU. We all know what Storm is about and why bringing her character into <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2434929/x-men-actress-has-ideas-for-a-storm-spinoff\">a leading role</a> in 2020, where effects are bigger and better, would be advantageous for the MCU. Another interesting point worth noting is that in <a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/\">Marvel Comics</a>, she was once the wife of T'Challa, a.k.a. Black Panther. The two have since split, but I would love to see a romance between the two develop within the MCU. A movie featuring the two sounds like an absolute blast, and maybe the perfect story for a future <em>Black Panther</em> movie to tackle. The world has been <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465488/channing-tatum-rumored-to-direct-the-gambit-movie-after-everyone-else-passes\">teased for years</a> about the release of a <em>Gambit</em> movie, but sadly, it's <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485605/after-gambit-delays-channing-tatum-has-finally-found-his-comic-book-adaptation\">reached a point</a> where it seems unlikely Channing Tatum would fit the role. The good news is there's still a chance the character could get a fresh start in the MCU, and hopefully with a young actor who has the talent to turn him into a hero worthy of solo adventures that would make him the Wolverine of sorts for a new generation. I know, I can't really envision it either, but I think that's more because I'm used to projects surrounding this hero disappointing. If you're looking for the ultimate character to tease major events in the MCU, Bishop is the man. Traditionally the character travels back in time to meet with the X-Men and potentially alter the events of the future, which are almost always post-apocalyptic. Therefore, his actions are always more dictated by what can change his time, which may sometimes be initiating events that sound evil in the present. For example, Bishop once tried to kill Kitty Pryde and Cable once, even though all three are generally seen as heroes. Bringing a character in like this could add a level of tension to the MCU I could really get behind. Franklin Richards is the son of The Fantastic Four's Reed and Sue Richards, and one of the most powerful mutants in existence. His power literally <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2486457/the-eternals-deviants-after-kevin-feiges-confirmation-what-you-need-to-know\">rivals that of the Celestials</a>, many of whom are viewed as gods in the MCU. With <em>The Fantastic Four</em>, a guaranteed entry into the MCU, I'd love to see if Marvel Studios will try to touch the character of Franklin Richards with a 10 foot pole. Something tells me he's just a little too powerful, but I hope I'm wrong. Are there any other mutants worthy of entry into the MCU to shake things up?

    "content": "The Marvel Cinematic Universe has big plans for the future. To keep it all straight, we've laid out the next few years' worth of Marvel Studios films in this feature, which will take you through all of the official titles announced for Phase 4 and Phase 5 \u2013 as well as the unscheduled projects that are currently in development. Fans spent years calling for Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero movie, and for the longest time it seemed like a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2476936/black-widow\"><em>Black Widow</em></a> solo film would be the perfect solution to the request \u2013 what with Scarlett Johansson's character's being arguably the most popular heroine in the franchise. That didn't wind up happening, as both Evangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne and Brie Larson's Carol Danvers broke the glass ceiling with their titular roles in <em>Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp</em> and <em>Captain Marvel</em>, but that doesn't mean a <em>Black Widow</em> movie isn't happening. In fact, it's currently set up to be the first title in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Phase Four. In July 2018 <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2449169/the-black-widow-movie-has-its-director\">it was revealed</a> that Cate Shorthand had signed on to direct the feature, her previous work including the period drama <em>Lore</em> and the thriller <em>Berlin Syndrome</em>. The movie will take place between the events of <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> and <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, and will largely be set in Europe, with Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff facing demons from her past including the horrors of the Red Room training facility. In addition to Scarlett Johansson, the movie will also feature David Harbour as Alexei Shostakov a.k.a. The Red Guardian, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, O-T Fagbenle as Mason, and Rachel Weisz as Melina. It's also been confirmed that the blockbuster will bring the fan favorite character <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476954/taskmaster-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-black-widow-villain\">Taskmaster</a> to the big screen for the first time, but it has not yet been said who is playing the role. When it comes to the cosmic side of Marvel Comics, the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have only scratched the surface thus far. Sure, we've seen a few <em>Thor</em> and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> movies, and <em>Captain Marvel</em> opened some new doors, but there are thousands upon thousands of beings out in the cosmos that have yet to make their live-action debut. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2476930/eternals\"><em>The Eternals</em></a> is a tremendous step in that direction, as there is a whole world of godly characters created by Jack Kirby that should make for tremendous exploration on the big screen, and we will get an excellent dose of all that when the project is released as the first Marvel title of 2021. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2458052/marvels-eternals-movie-just-took-a-big-step-forward\">Chloe Zhao</a> was previously in the running to take the helm of the <em>Black Widow</em> movie, and while she didn't get that job, Marvel Studios decided they wanted her to stick around to make <em>The Eternals</em>. The comics tell the story of a race of beings created from proto-humans by god-like aliens known as Celestials, and it's been said that romance will be at the center of the intergalactic story. The project is putting together an excellent ensemble with Richard Madden as Ikaris, Kumail Nanjiani as Kingo, Lauren Ridloff as Makkari, Brian Tyree Henry as Phastos, Salma Hayek as Ajak, Lia McHugh as Sprite, Don Lee as Gilgamesh, Gemma Chan as Sersei, Barry Keoghan as Druig, Kit Harington as Dane Whitman a.k.a. Black Knight,and Angelina Jolie as Thena. We've seen the Marvel Cinematic Universe explore a wide number of genres over the years, from the conspiracy thriller that was <em>Captain America: The Winter Solider</em>, to the noir roots in <em>Iron Man 3</em>, but in Phase 4 Marvel Studios will make their first kung fu film. Specifically, they are currently developing a solo movie for the hero Shang-Chi, a master of martial arts that was introduced into the pages of Marvel Comics back in 1973. In March 2019 the studio hired Destin Daniel Cretton to take the helm of the project. Like many others before entering this universe, he doesn't have a ton of blockbuster experience on his resume, but he definitely has some standout titles \u2013 including the brilliant 2013 indie film <em>Short Term 12</em>, and the hard-hitting drama <em>Just Mercy</em> in 2019. As the title suggests, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2476929/shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings\"><em>Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings</em></a> will find its titular hero going toe-to-toe with the titular evil organization, and already the project has hired actors for three key roles. It was officially announced at San Diego Comic-Con 2019 that up-and-comer Simu Liu will be playing Marvel's Master Of Kung-Fu, while Tony Leung has signed on to play the real Mandarin (not to be confused with Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery from <em>Iron Man 3</em>). Awkwafina will also have a role to play in the film, but her role has not yet been identified. Being technically classified as \"Sony movies,\" the <em>Spider-Man</em> films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have always been a different beast in the grand scope of the franchise \u2013 and it's because of this strangeness that the upcoming sequel to <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em> nearly fell apart in its early days. Following the release of the webhead solo movie in summer 2019, Marvel Studios/Walt Disney Studios and Sony Pictures had a contract dispute, and as a result it looked like Spidey's future in the <em>Avengers</em> world was over. Fortunately, however, the issues were ultimately resolved, and now the blockbuster is back on track to be released in November 2021. Jon Watts, who directed both <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em> and <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em>, is back in the director's chair for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493586/spider-man-3-what-we-know-so-far-about-the-far-from-home-sequel\">the untitled <em>Spider-Man 3</em></a>, and Tom Holland and Zendaya are confirmed to return as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man and MJ, respectively. Currently there are no plot details available, but the film is expected to pick up where the last one ended, featuring the titular hero trying to survive in a world where everyone knows his secret identity and blames him for a terrorist attack in London. For the longest time it was assumed that Marvel Studios wouldn't expand their solo movie series beyond three features \u2013 with Iron Man and Captain America being the perfect examples \u2013 but the God of Thunder has struck down that \"rule\" with a blast of lightning. It's no secret that Chris Hemsworth doesn't really love the first two <em>Thor</em> films, but his experience making <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> totally changed his perspective on playing the character, and now we will be getting a <em>Thor 4</em> in 2022 with the brilliant title <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2476928/thor-love-and-thunder\"><em>Thor: Love And Thunder</em></a>. Certainly one of the most compelling reasons for Marvel Studios to make this film is that they have struck a deal with the perfect filmmaker to do it. Taika Waititi, who helmed the critically-acclaimed <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, has signed on the dotted line, and is now set to come back to direct the next chapter in the series. It's been confirmed that the story will pick up after the events of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> and find Chris Hemsworth's eponymous hero searching for a new purpose. He will also be joined by some amazing co-stars, as Tessa Thompson will officially come back as Valkyrie (who will be ruling as the King of Asgard), and the movie is also going to feature the epic return of Natalie Portman's Jane Foster, who is going to be transformed into The Mighty Thor in the movie. Its been confirmed that Christian Bale will be playing the central antagonist, but we do not yet know the identity of the character he's playing. As they have since pretty much the beginning, Marvel's plans moving forward will include mixing things up between sequels and original projects. After all, while the latter allow things to constantly feel fresh and new, the former lets us see a lot more of the characters we've previously fallen in love with. This most definitely extends to Doctor Strange, as Marvel President Kevin Feige <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2443040/kevin-feige-explains-marvels-approach-to-mixing-new-solo-movies-and-sequels-in-phase-4\">confirmed to <strong>CinemaBlend</strong></a> in summer 2018 that a <em>Doctor Strange 2</em> was in development, and now we know that project is taking form as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2476932/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness\"><em>Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness</em></a>. The project is set to be the fourth release of Phase Four, and while it was initially confirmed in late 2018 that Scott Derrickson will be back to direct, the filmmaker and the studio parted ways amicably due to creative differences. In <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489713/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-may-have-found-its-new-director\">February 2020</a>, it was reported that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489713/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-may-have-found-its-new-director\">Sam Raimi</a> had entered talks to direct the blockbuster. It has not yet been said who will serve as the main antagonist of <em>Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness</em>, but we have learned that the film will see Benedict Cumberbatch's Master Of The Mystic Arts teaming with a very interesting hero in a key supporting role: Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch. What's more, the story is going to be directly linked to the events that play out in the <em>WandaVision</em> Disney+ series. Both Benedict Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor will be back to play Wong and Karl Mordo, respectively. Is anyone in the world even remotely surprised that <em>Black Panther</em> is getting a sequel? Sure, it's not arriving until Phase 5, but there was no way that Marvel Studios wasn't going to take full advantage of what currently stands as its most successful solo character release. The first movie did an amazing job establishing the world of Wakanda, and <em>Black Panther 2</em> will offer the amazing opportunity to fully explore what the presence of the country on the world stage means for the entire planet. Ryan Coogler has signed on to take the helm of <em>Black Panther 2</em>, which, it should be noted, will not actually be the final title of the film. As for what the name of the movie actually is, Coogler turned down the opportunity to reveal that information \u2013 along with the planned villain, and the events that take place in the opening scene - in August 2019 when he stood on stage beside Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige at D23 Expo 2019. There are expectations that the film will see the return of Chadwick Boseman, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Winston Duke, Angela Bassett, and Martin Freeman, but nothing has been confirmed. Given that <em>Captain Marvel</em> was Marvel Studios' first billion dollar hit in 2019, <em>Captain Marvel 2</em> has long been predictable as a future project for the franchise, but similar to <em>Black Panther 2</em> it doesn't look like the company is rushing things at all. While it probably wouldn't have surprised anybody to see Brie Larson's Carol Danvers showing up again as the star of one of the Phase 4 titles, it turns out we'll have to wait until 2022 before the heroine returns in her next solo adventure. The release date for <em>Captain Marvel 2</em> was made official as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493885/marvel-studios-has-mapped-out-seven-of-its-next-movies-with-release-dates?pv=related_list\">part of the announcement</a> in April 2020 when Marvel Studios shuffled their schedule. It is not yet known who is going to direct the film, or when it will be set. Will the new plot involve her time spent trying to help the Skrulls establish a new homeworld? Or will it simply move forward to events post-<em>Avengers: Endgame</em>? Only time will tell at this point. The road to making <em>Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3</em> has been an odd one so far. Initially it looked like the film was going to be one of the earliest titles released as part of Marvel Phase 4, but then <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/podcast/2455044/heroblend-16-why-disney-wont-rehire-james-gunn\">all hell broke loose</a> when James Gunn lost the directing gig thanks to offensive Tweets he wrote nearly a decade ago. After that whole ordeal the filmmaker decided to make a move over to the DC Extended Universe \u2013 agreeing to script and helm the upcoming <em>The Suicide Squad</em> \u2013 but now everything appears to be mostly back on track, as Gunn has been reinstated and is once again set to make the conclusion to his <em>Guardians Of The Galaxy</em> trilogy. James Gunn has always said that the next sequel in the <em>Guardians</em> franchise will bring an end to the story of THIS version of the Guardians team, which includes Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Groot (Vin Diesel), Nebula (Karen Gillan) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff). It's not entirely clear how the tale will be concluded, and the project has been pushed back until after Gunn can complete work on <em>The Suicide Squad</em>, but to say that our excitement is at maximum about the project's latest developments would be an understatement. The future of the <em>Ant-Man And The Wasp</em> series was maintained as a mystery for a surprisingly long time. The two characters weren't mentioned at all during the presentations at San Diego Comic-Con 2019 and D23 Expo 2019, and there was no clear indication that the second sequel was something that Marvel Studios was interested in pursuing. Fortunately, that conversation changed in a big way in April 2020, as it was finally revealed that the follow-up to <em>Ant-Man And The Wasp</em> is in the works. The untitled <em>Ant-Man And The Wasp</em> sequel doesn't have a release date yet (hence its placement in this section of the feature), but it is definitely starting up. Peyton Reed, who helmed <em>Ant-Man</em> and <em>Ant-Man And The Wasp</em>, will be back in the director's chair, and <em>Rick and Morty</em> writer and co-producer Jeff Loveness has come aboard to write the script. We will presumably see the return of Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly as the leads, with Michael Douglas, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Pena in key supporting roles, but those details have not yet been revealed. Now that the Disney-Fox merger is complete, it's only a matter of time before we finally get to see the Marvel Cinematic Universe version of the Fantastic Four \u2013 though those hoping that a new version of the team would fittingly debut as part of the franchise's Phase 4 plans were left disappointed by the slate news that was dropped at San Diego Comic-Con 2019. While Marvel's First Family was name-dropped by Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige, no concrete details about their developing next feature were offered. We can't actually say for certain at this point if the <em>Fantastic Four</em> will be included as a part of Phase 5, but it probably is a pretty safe call given that Marvel is keenly aware of the interest that the project has already generated. There have been rumors that Peyton Reed may be potentially involved with the project (having developed a big screen take on the group years ago), and he <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2440199/could-peyton-reeds-fantastic-four-be-made-in-the-mcu\">hasn't exactly shut the door to yet</a>, even while continuing to work on the <em>Ant-Man And The Wasp Series</em>. The <em>X-Men</em> franchise that existed for nearly two decades is now all but totally over (as we're still waiting for the release of <em>The New Mutants</em>), and fans worldwide are over-the-top excited for their chance to finally see the legendary mutant characters make their debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The hitch is that introducing mutants to the expansive franchise is no small undertaking... so Marvel Studios is playing things smart by not rushing things. It's the reason why Professor X's team won't be showing up in Phase 4, and they honestly may not be showing up in Phase 5 either, depending on how long the phase actually winds up being. Like with the <em>Fantastic Four</em>, Kevin Feige name-dropped \"the mutants\" during the Marvel Studios Hall H panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2019, but he didn't offer any actual information regarding when we'll get to see them. There's a good chance it won't happen before 2025. Most of the projects announced by Marvel Studios during San Diego Comic-Con 2019 were ones that fans were already vaguely aware of, but this is one that took everybody by surprise. The company has held the rights to <em>Blade</em> for a number of years now, but it was only during the annual summer event that they announced that they are finally doing something with it. And what's more, the project has already lined up a star. While we currently have no idea when he'll actually make his big screen debut, two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali will soon be playing Blade in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This news may come as a bit of a surprise to those who are fans of the Marvel Netflix shows, as Ali notably played Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes in the first season of <em>Luke Cage</em>, but we'll all just have to put that in the back of our minds while watching him hunting vampires. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1442349/Iron-Man\"><em>Iron Man</em></a> (2008)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1443949/Incredible-Hulk\"><em>The Incredible Hulk</em></a> (2008)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1448699/Iron-Man-2\"><em>Iron Man 2</em></a> (2010)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1448649/Thor\"><em>Thor</em></a> (2011)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1448629/Captain-America-First-Avenger\"><em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em></a> (2011)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1448619/Avengers\"><em>The Avengers</em></a> (2012) <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1459629/Iron-Man-3\"><em>Iron Man 3</em></a> (2013)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1459609/Thor-Dark-World\"><em>Thor: The Dark World</em></a> (2013)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1459269/Captain-America-Winter-Soldier\"><em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em></a> (2014)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1459759/Guardians-Galaxy\"><em>Guardians Of The Galaxy</em></a> (2014)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1460409/Avengers-Age-Ultron\"><em>The Avengers: Age of Ultron</em></a> (2015)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1459769/Ant-Man\"><em>Ant-Man</em></a> (2015) <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1462439/Captain-America-Civil-War\"><em>Captain America: Civil War</em></a> (2016)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1465179/Doctor-Strange\"><em>Doctor Strange</em></a> (2016)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1464629/Guardians-Galaxy-Vol-2\"><em>Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2</em></a> (2017)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1465819/Spider-Man-Homecoming\"><em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em></a> (2017)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1464069/Thor-Ragnarok\"><em>Thor: Ragnarok</em></a> (2017)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1465189/Black-Panther/\"><em>Black Panther</em></a> (2018)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1465209/Avengers-Infinity-War\"><em>Avengers: Infinity War</em></a> (2018)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1467159/Ant-Man-Wasp\"><em>Ant-Man And The Wasp</em></a> (2018)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1465199/Captain-Marvel\"><em>Captain Marvel</em></a> (2019)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1465219/avengers-endgame\"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a> (2019)<br/> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1599660/spider-man-far-from-home\"><em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em></a> (2019) NJ native who calls LA home; lives in a Dreamatorium.

    "title": "30 Best Sci-Fi Movies Of All Time",
    "content": "Science fiction is quite simply one of the most popular genres of film that we have. The creation of far away places and futuristic technology seems to be exactly what the medium of film was designed to create. Science fiction on film has been around for as long as there have been movies. But which ones are the best? Figuring that out is a nearly impossible task. But, we're going to do it anyway. All the movie minds here at CinemaBlend got together and made suggestions of potential films that could go on that list. From there we picked 30 of them. From there we argued about which ones were being left off. Then we changed the list around and argued some more. We think we have something that works pretty well, though ask us tomorrow and we may have a different answer. For the moment, here are the 30 best science fiction movies ever, ranked. There's a lot to love about <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1555540/one-huge-problem-with-the-robocop-reboot-according-to-the-original-movies-director\"><em>Robocop</em></a>, and, to be clear, we're talking about the original version from 1987. If you're into hyper-violent action movies, it has that. If you just like science fiction movies with cyborgs, you're covered. However, one thing that elevates <em>Robocop</em> from simply being a fun movie to becoming a great one is the satire. The film actually has something important to say about modern society, something that might be even more relevant today than it was in the 1980s. It's a smart film, that just so happens to have people turned into a red mist via high caliber machine guns. Luc Besson's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/\"><em>The Fifth Element</em></a> is one of those films that took a while to become a go to science fiction movie. It did solid box office business but was far from a huge hit when first released. However, through home video and streaming services more and more people have come across the film and it seems to have become a film with little negative reaction. Bruce Willis plays a cab driver who gets pulled into a fight for galactic survival by a beautiful woman played by <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1608180/milla-jovovich-says-resident-evil-stunt-accident-was-a-nightmare\">Milla Jovovich</a>. The premise is simple but thanks to delightfully fun characters like Chris Tucker's Ruby Rhod and a musical number that nobody will ever forget, this one will survive the test of time. In the 1980s the computer became a device that the average family could afford, as such, there was an explosion in ownership, yet, in many ways, people really didn't understand them. This aspect of science fiction made real was the premise of <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Tron-3-Hasn-t-Happened-Yet-According-Olivia-Wilde-90297.html\"><em>Tron</em></a>, a film that wondered what was really happening inside the machine. While the film may feel a little dated by current standards, you simply can't underestimate what the movie brought to the screen upon its release. The computer effects that created the digital world had simply never been seen before. It was a leap forward in technology that dozens of films would be influenced by. While most science fiction movies take place among the stars, some of them can work within the confines of our own planet. <em>The Abyss</em> finds alien life residing at the bottom of the ocean, showing that <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1604710/watch-james-cameron-tour-his-avatar-theme-park-have-his-mind-blown\">James Cameron</a> has been wondering what's going on in our waters since long before <em>Titanic</em>. The claustrophobia of the environment is palpable, making the movie an exciting ride all the way through. In addition, it brought computer generated characters to the next level thanks to groundbreaking work from <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Difficult-Digital-Effect-Warcraft-Helping-ILM-Perfect-131617.html\">Industrial Light &amp; Magic</a>. A little surprising, considering the film opened to disappointing box office numbers. If you haven't seen this one, fix that soon. While director <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Crazy-Expensive-Sequence-Christopher-Nolan-May-Creating-Dunkirk-135907.html\">Christopher Nolan</a> did a lot of good to bring credibility to the comic book genre with his <em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy, it was a film he made in between those movies that was truly revolutionary. In many ways, the set-up was that of a simple heist. However, the trick was that the information our team needed to steal was inside somebody's head, leading them to use technology that allowed them to enter dreams of unsuspecting victims. <em>Inception</em> has many of the hallmarks of the best science fiction. It creates a fictional world with specific rules that the story must abide by, making the situation feel more real than it could ever be. This, combined with some stunning visuals setpieces, captured practically rather than digitally, makes <em>Inception</em> a worthy recent entry to this list. The concept of artificial intelligence has been covered in countless science fiction movies over the years. However, it has never been done as well as it was in the recent <em>Ex Machina</em>. <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1621839/see-alicia-vikander-as-lara-croft-from-the-new-tomb-raider-movie\">Alicia Vikander</a> plays Ava, an artificial life form that may, or may not, be capable of true consciousness and emotion. Can humans truly relate to a machine the way we relate to each other? And if we can, what exactly does that mean about our concepts of what it means to be alive? <em>Ex Machina</em> is the all too rare dramatic science fiction movie. It has no ray guns or explosions. It's ultimately about people, even if one of the people isn't entirely real. Tom Crusie is almost always an actor who's good for making a fun time at the movies. However, the criminally underrated <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1578789/edge-of-tomorrow-2-will-revolutionize-sequels-according-to-doug-liman\"><em>Edge of Tomorrow</em></a> is so much more than that. The story follows Cruise's character, a military officer who has never seen combat before but is now forced to the front lines, as he accidentally gets exposed to alien technology and discovers that the reason the aliens are winning the war is because they have the ability to travel back and repeat time and learn from their mistakes. Once he gains the same ability we get to see him use it to learn how to fight and try to win. Also, you get to watch Tom Cruise get blown up, a lot. And, while we're discussing time travel, let's talk about what is probably the most popular time travel movie ever made. Even more rare than the science fiction drama is the science fiction comedy, yet, <em>Back to the Future</em> does it perfectly. It's true that the science fiction mechanic of the film exists only to give a reason to have 1980s Marty McFly experience the world of 1955, yet, the movie deals with many of your standard time travel tropes including accidentally changing the past to negate the future, the bootstrap paradox, not to mention the possibility of accidentally becoming your own father, which is funny, and also gross. Terry Gilliam has directed some gloriously fantastic science fiction, including a couple of films that came very close to making this list. However, his best science fiction movie has got to be <em>12 Monkeys</em>. The story of a man sent back in time to prevent the spread of a plague would seem straight forward, but straight forward is something that never happens when Terry Gilliam is involved. A movie that earned <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000093/\">Brad Pitt</a> his first Oscar nomination and also contains one of the best performances by Bruce Willis simply can't be left off this list. The question of whether or not we're alone in the universe is a consistent theme in science fiction films. The answering of that question was the subject of one of the great classics of the genre, <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em>. Today the words \"Klaatu barada nikto\" still survive in pop culture, which shows just what an impact the movie had. One wonders how many people even know that this is where the phrase comes from. So often when we do meet aliens in movies they are hostile invaders, but even back in 1951 a movie wondered if it was possible that we were the aggressive ones. Most of the movies on this list are big and popular films that you're likely familiar with, even if you haven't seen them. <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Weinsteins-Think-Americans-Too-Dumb-Bong-Joon-ho-Version-Snowpiercer-38871.html\"><em>Snowpiercer</em></a> may be something of an unknown quantity, however. It's fairly recent (2013) release date combined with its small release overall may make this one a film you haven't even heard of, but you should change that soon. Korean director Bong Joon-ho's English-language debut sees Chris Evans as a passenger on a train in a future world that has been taken over by ice. Only those on a constantly moving train survive and quality of life is dictated by your position on the train. Those in the back start a revolt that takes them forward on the massive train. Whether you're looking for great action sequences or an examination of society you'll get both with <em>Snowpiercer</em>. There are so many ways one could describe <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.</em> It's a science fiction drama, it's a romantic comedy, it's just a general mind-fuck of a movie. <em>Eternal Sunshine</em> is all these things and more. Charlie Kaufman is known for writing some of the more offbeat stories in recent memory but this one may very well be his masterpiece. By the time this one came out we knew that Jim Carrey wasn't just a comedian and we already knew how great Kate Winslet was, but we saw entirely different sides of both actors here. The story follows two ex-lovers as they decide to get the memories of each other erased entirely from their heads. The movie is utterly bizarre but that doesn't stop it from being an emotional journey. No list of science fiction films could possibly be complete without the movie that created one of the biggest action heroes of all-time. <em>The Terminator</em> introduced Arnold Schwarzenegger as an unstoppable killing machine and for a guy that looked like he did, audiences bought it. While the movie doesn't have the flashy special effects of future sequels, that's part of why this movie still stands up. It's a desperate fight against an unstoppable force; it's not supposed to be pretty. While most of the movies that followed never held up, the reason they even tried is because the original was so good. One of the best science fiction films ever made deals with elements of artificial intelligence, love between artificial beings, and the destruction of human habitat. Also, it's an animated Pixar movie. Pixar has a near perfect record when it comes to creating good movies, however, <em>Wall-E</em> may be in a class by itself. It's a film so good that the movie doesn't even require dialogue for half its runtime. It is by far the best animated science fiction movie ever made and Wall-E will be one of our favorite sci-fi characters forever. Wall-E and Eve have one of the great cinematic romances of all time. While actors performing against non-existent characters on a green screen is fairly commonplace now, such things were mostly unheard of prior to the release of Steven Spielberg's <em>Jurassic Park</em>. What's more, while many digital effects from the era don't really hold up today, the dinosaurs of <em>Jurassic Park</em> do. That, combined with one of John Williams' best scores makes for a movie that's entertaining and exciting every time you see it. Also, it has dinosaurs in it and they eat people. You really can't go wrong with that. When a science fiction movie gets nominated for an Oscar, you know it's something special. <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1523380/the-martian-extended-cut-includes-9-new-scenes-heres-what-happens-in-them\"><em>The Martian</em></a> is the most recent movie on this list and while it might be a little soon, in the end, it was just too good to ignore. While the movie is <em>Cast Away</em> in space, it's also so much more. This movie just has everything that hardcore science fiction fans love, space travel, alien worlds, and enough scientific fact built in to make the story plausible. Add in the fact that the film is legitimately funny and you've got a movie that is already one of the best ever made in the genre. Following up Ridley Scott's <em>Alien</em> could not have been an easy task for <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1620709/the-hysterical-way-james-cameron-pitched-aliens\">James Cameron</a>. The director made at least one brilliant decision, however. Rather than try to recreate the pulse-pounding terror of the original film, he traded some of that tension in for space marine action. <em>Aliens</em> and <em>Alien</em> are two very different movies and people will argue over which is the better one. We had to make a call one way or the other and so we're putting the sequel here, but it is, without doubt, one of the great sci-fi action films. Fans of the original need not worry. We'll get there. Who could have possibly dreamed that all these years later a movie about a planet run by apes would still be so popular? And yet, here we are. While the original may be best known for its famous twist ending as opposed to anything else, it's influence on popular culture simply can't be overlooked. It received sequels, adaptations, spoofs, and now a new series of movies that have been as good as anything the series has ever produced. None of that happens without Charlton Heston and the \"damn dirty apes\" which earns it a spot on this list. You can't really talk about science fiction without including <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1596750/is-star-trek-4-getting-underway-simon-pegg-is-hinting-at-it\"><em>Star Trek</em></a> in the conversation. For a series that's gone on as long as it has, the movie side has seen its ups and downs, but the best of them still has to be the second film in the franchise: <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn.</em> If you were a hardcore <em>Star Trek</em> fan then this film was a godsend as it brought back one of the great villains from the original series. However, you didn't need to be steeped in lore to enjoy Ricardo Montalban's over the top evil performance. The movie's so good the new film series wanted to do their own take on it, but really, there's no way to improve on perfection. While the original <em>Terminator</em> is a classic, it was the sequel, <em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day,</em> that took the franchise to the next level. This time Arnold got to be the hero as he was sent back in time to protect John Conner from the next generation of Terminator. James Cameron has always been one to latch on to the newest technology in filmmaking and for <em>Terminator 2</em> it was digital morphing effects that allowed the T-1000 to transform in front of our eyes. Add to that the fact that the film was rated-R, during a time period where the <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1536299/new-lawsuit-may-change-what-pg-13-movies-are-allowed-to-show\">PG-13</a> rating was beginning to establish movie dominance and fans got exactly the sequel they wanted, bigger and better. You know that you've made a seminal work of science fiction when your movie is so good, people forget it's a remake. John Carpenter's <em>The Thing</em> technically follows 1951's <em>The Thing From Another World</em> and while that movie is still pretty good, it doesn't hold a candle to the masterclass in science fiction and horror that Carpenter's film was. The movie is still debated today as the ending is left <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1550760/a-huge-secret-about-john-carpenters-the-thing-may-have-just-been-revealed\">open to interpretation</a>. Was The Thing destroyed, or is one of the final survivors actually a monster in disguise? What is there to say that hasn't already been said about the <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Modern-Trailer-Original-Star-Wars-Trilogy-Epic-Cryptic-128187.html\"><em>Star Wars</em> trilogy</a>. It quite simply changed the way Hollywood works. While some, including George Lucas himself, aren't necessarily thrilled by that fact, it's the world we live in now. <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> was the film that proved that the pop culture circus that surrounded the first film was no accident. In many ways, the sequel is even superior to the original. With one of the greatest twists in the history of film included, <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> will never be forgotten. So often in science fiction, the aliens are the bad guys that need to be defeated. However, Steven Spielberg's <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Behind-Scenes-E-T-Casting-Video-Make-You-Cry-68025.html\"><em>E.T.: the Extra-Terrestrial</em></a> doesn't just create a sympathetic alien that needs to be protected, it puts that protection in the hands of kids, making the movie something that entire families can enjoy. As such, it becomes one of those films that people make sure is seen by future generations. It's a heartwarming story that can hit you in the feels whether it's the first time you've seen it or the 50th. Made in 1927, when movies were still without sound, <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Metropolis-Rise-Again-7160.html\"><em>Metropolis</em></a> is still one of the most influential science fiction movies ever made. It's visuals and effects were ahead of their time, fitting for a movie that portrayed a world that was highly advanced in technology, if not in humanity. It's difficult to argue that without <em>Metropolis</em> we may have never had any of the other films on this list. If you've never seen the film it is worth it to take the time and find it, if only to see the precursor to so many other genre classics. Hey look, it's Steven Spielberg again! The accomplished director has numerous great films on his filmography but when it comes to the science fiction genre, <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Look-Amazing-Aliens-From-Steven-Spielberg-Abandoned-Close-Encounters-Sequel-43186.html\"><em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em></a> is clearly his magnum opus. The question of whether or not we are alone in the universe is a topic in several films on this list, but while most films are about the answer, <em>Close Encounters</em> is a film about the question. It's about humanity's fascination with the <em>idea</em> of aliens and the lengths to which some will go to find a connection with the rest of the galaxy. It's a beautiful film and clearly one of the top ten in all of science fiction. The best movies are the ones that turn out to be great when you had no idea what to expect. <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1636920/the-matrix-reboot-may-not-actually-be-a-reboot-at-all\"><em>The Matrix</em></a> surprised pretty much everybody when it was released in 1999. It's cutting edge use of \"bullet time\" cameras and \"wire-fu\" martial arts combined with a cyberpunk aesthetic was quite simply a combination that nobody had seen before. Add a solid story with a healthy dose of philosophical discussion on the nature of reality and the result is so popular that the universe is still being mined for stories to this day. We can only hope that any future <em>Matrix</em> films take after the original, and not any of the sequels. The fact that <em>Blade Runner</em> is seeing <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/news/1563809/blade-runner-2-reveals-its-title-and-a-key-new-detail\">a sequel</a> 25 years after the original debuted is all it takes to show how this film has survived over the years. Ridley Scott's story about a future where androids virtually indistinguishable from humans live amongst us captured the imagination. Perhaps one of the reasons the film has been so popular is that it has so many versions to choose from. No fewer than seven different cuts have been released over the years. The fact that so much work has been done following the initial release not only shows that fans are still interested but it also helps to show how involved the film's story truly is, that it can be looked at from so many different perspectives. While <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> is viewed by many to be the high point of the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise, you simply can't understate just how important a film the original movie is. It not only launched the biggest property in the history of pop culture, but it changed the way movies were made and the way science fiction was viewed by the masses. No longer was it simply the purview of little kids watching <em>Flash Gordon</em> serials. Science fiction was now serious business. Everybody tried to do their own <em>Star Wars</em> after the original became the highest grossing film of all time. They all failed to match its brilliance. \"In space, no one can hear you scream.\" With that simple phrase, we were introduced to some of the most terrifying alien creatures that have ever been created. Luckily, we were also introduced to one of the most badass heroes that science fiction, or any genre, has ever seen. Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley broke the mold when it came to genre heroines and she's still one of the greatest ever created. <em>Alien</em> was as good a science fiction film as it was a horror movie and the two are inextricably intertwined with each other. It is absolutely one of the best science fiction movies ever made. Every movie on this list is a great one, but all of them owe something to Stanley Kubrick's <em>2001: A Space Odyssey.</em> The movie really has everything you could possibly want. It's got impressive outer space scenes. It's got drama that borders on horror thanks to a slightly deranged computer. Then it's got completely off-the-wall imagery and symbolism from Stanley Kubrick that still has people talking and asking questions to this day. After all these years we still can't stop thinking about <em>2001</em>, which is why it's still the best science fiction movie ever made. Dirk (or Stephen, depending on who's asking) is a Northern California native currently living outside Sacramento, CA. After more than a dozen years working in the consumer electronics industry he had a mid-life crisis and, instead of buying a sports car, he changed careers and became an entertainment writer. He covers film for CinemaBlend, which means he hasn't had the time for a TV show in years. Subscribe To 30 Best Sci-Fi Movies Of All Time Updates",

With TV shows like <em>Doctor Who,</em> <em>The Big Bang Theory,</em> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2490662/how-much-the-friends-cast-is-being-paid-for-hbo-may-reunion-special\">yes, even <em>Friends</em></a> on the way to people\u2019s screens, there\u2019s going to be plenty to watch on opening day, not to mention the weeks and months to come. But let\u2019s not forget, a ton of movies will be coming online when HBO Max starts to opens its doors and unleash waves of streaming entertainment for the masses. In fact, the complete list of movies that will be available on day one and beyond are what you see in front of you. Grouped by decade, we\u2019ll be laying out the movies that you can look forward to during HBO Max's gradual rollout, and we\u2019ll even highlight some of the movies we feel are the most noteworthy titles to watch. Feel free to explore the entire lineup though, as there\u2019s something for everybody in HBO Max\u2019s vast collection of cinematic wonder. And you never know what you'll find upon close inspection; like, say, the entire <em>Harry Potter</em> franchise from J.K. Rowling's <em>Wizarding World</em>! You can <a href=\"https://www.hbomax.com/?utm_source=cinema_blend&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=pre-launch\">sign up for HBO Max here</a>. Starting in the most recent decade of filmmaking gems, we\u2019ve got a collection of films that mix prestige promise with blockbuster thrills. DC Comics films like <em>Joker</em> and <em>Wonder Woman</em> will complement the other DC Comics originals and legacy content that will be included in the HBO Max library. Meanwhile, if you\u2019re looking for something a little more romantic, there\u2019s the bittersweet <em>A Star Is Born</em> remake, starring Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, as well as the hysterical rom-com hit <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em>, for you to behold. Of course, if the thrill of adventure is in your interest, <em>The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey</em> or <em>Fast Five</em> will both be on hand to satisfy your quest for excitement. All of these options are only a fraction of what the 2010s have to offer, as seen in the list below. <em>Downton Abbey</em> (2019)<br/> <em>Hellboy</em> (2019)<br/> <em>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</em> (2019)<br/> <em>Isn\u2019t it Romantic</em> (2019)<br/> <em>IT: Chapter 2</em> (2019)<br/> <em>John Wick 3</em> (2019)<br/> <em>Joker</em> (2019)<br/> <em>Ready or Not</em> (2019)<br/> <em>Shazam!</em> (2019)<br/> <em>Us</em> (2019)<br/> <em>X-Men: Dark Phoenix</em> (2019)<br/> <em>Yesterday</em> (2019)<br/> <em>A Star is Born</em> (2018)<br/> <em>Aquaman</em> (2018)<br/> <em>Batman: Gotham Knight</em> (2018)<br/> <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> (2018)<br/> <em>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</em> (2018)<br/> <em>Her Smell</em> (2018)<br/> <em>Mamma Mia!

And yet, romance thrived in this new age, as <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> had all the right answers and <em>Moulin Rouge!</em> hit all the right notes to make love happen in a heartbeat. Though there was still room for some laughs with <em>How to Lose a Guy In 10 Days</em>. But if you want a movie that hits the intersection of both of those worlds, then you should look no futher than director Robert Zemeckis\u2019 <em>Cast Away</em>. Through his stranding on a deserted island, Tom Hanks\u2019 protagonist fights to survive in an unfamiliar land, if only to return to the woman he loves back home. And just think, that\u2019s only a handful of HBO Max\u2019s available films from the 2000s! <em>Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince (2009)</em><br/> <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> (2009)<br/> <em>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</em> (2009)<br/> <em>In Bruges</em> (2008)<br/> <em>Quantum of Solace</em> (2008)<br/> <em>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2</em> (2008)<br/> <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em> (2008)<br/> <em>Tropic Thunder</em> (2008)<br/> <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em> (2007)<br/> <em>Live Free or Die Hard</em> (2007)<br/> <em>Hairspray</em> (2007)<br/> <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)</em><br/> <em>Casino Royale</em> (2006)<br/> <em>Half Nelson</em> (2006)<br/> <em>John Tucker Must Die</em> (2006)<br/> <em>Snakes on a Plane</em> (2006)<br/> <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)</em><br/> <em>Mr &amp; Mrs Smith</em> (2005)<br/> <em>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</em> (2005)<br/> <em>The Family Stone</em> (2005)<br/> <em>War of the Worlds</em> (2005)<br/> <em>Closer</em> (2004)<br/> <em>Harold &amp; Kumar go to White Castle</em> (2004)<br/> <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)</em><br/> <em>Van Helsing</em> (2004)<br/> <em>Cold Mountain</em> (2003)<br/> <em>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</em> (2003)<br/> <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</em> (2003)<br/> <em>Love Actually</em> (2003)<br/> <em>Scary Movie 3</em> (2003)<br/> <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> (2003)<br/> <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)</em><br/> <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone (2001)</em> The first rule about the 1990s is that you've absolutely got to talk about the 1990s. Riding the high of those blockbuster days, the market started to twist and turn traditional hits into even more exciting features. Nowhere was this easier to see than in how historical epics got a kilt-clad revamp with Mel Gibson's <em>Braveheart</em>, and romantic comedies got an upgrade with <em>Notting Hill</em>. Dramedies took some interesting turns too, as Ben Affleck and Matt Damon wrote and starred in the heart-wrenching journey that was <em>Good Will Hunting.</em> Even the legendary Robin Williams hit <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em> took what could have been a standard comedy or drama and mixed the genres together into a touching combination of heart and humor. And if you ever lost your faith in the '90s, needing some inspiration to kick you into gear, there was always <em>The Mighty Ducks</em> and their intense hockey playing prowess that would teach you to fly yet again. Though if you really wanted to steer into the irony and snark of the late '90s, there was always <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2488319/brad-pitt-reminisces-about-that-time-everyone-hated-fight-club\">a <em>Fight Club</em> meeting</a> around the corner. <em>American Pie</em> (1999)<br/> <em>Analyze This</em> (1999)<br/> <em>Boys Don\u2019t Cry</em> (1999)<br/> <em>Deep Blue Sea</em> (1999)<br/> <em>Fight Club</em> (1999)<br/> <em>Notting Hill</em> (1999)<br/> <em>The Thomas Crown Affair</em> (1999)<br/> <em>Three Kings</em> (1999)<br/> <em>Armageddon</em> (1998)<br/> <em>Gia</em> (1998)<br/> <em>Great Expectations</em> (1998)<br/> <em>Hope Floats</em> (1998)<br/> <em>Lethal Weapon 4</em> (1998)<br/> <em>Practical Magic</em> (1998)<br/> <em>Alien Resurrection</em> (1997)<br/> <em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> (1997)<br/> <em>Contact</em> (1997)<br/> <em>Good Will Hunting</em> (1997)<br/> <em>Grosse Pointe Blank</em> (1997)<br/> <em>Selena</em> (1997)<br/> <em>The Devil\u2019s Advocate</em> (1997)<br/> <em>A Time to Kill</em> (1996)<br/> <em>Broken Arrow</em> (1996)<br/> <em>D3: The Mighty Ducks</em> (1996)<br/> <em>One Fine Day</em> (1996)<br/> <em>Set it Off</em> (1996)<br/> <em>Striptease</em> (1996)<br/> <em>Swingers</em> (1996)<br/> <em>That Thing You Do!</em> (1996)<br/> <em>Babe</em> (1995)<br/> <em>Batman Forever</em> (1995)<br/> <em>Braveheart</em> (1995)<br/> <em>Die Hard with a Vengeance</em> (1995)<br/> <em>Hackers</em> (1995)<br/> <em>D2: The Mighty Ducks</em> (1994)<br/> <em>Muriel\u2019s Wedding</em> (1994)<br/> <em>Police Academy: Mission to Moscow</em> (1994)<br/> <em>True Lies</em> (1994)<br/> <em>Wes Craven\u2019s New Nightmare</em> (1994)<br/> <em>Batman: Mask of the Phantasm</em> (1993)<br/> <em>Mrs. Doubtfire</em> (1993)<br/> <em>Alien 3</em> (1992)<br/> <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em> (1992)<br/> <em>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York</em> (1992)<br/> <em>Lethal Weapon 3</em> (1992)<br/> <em>The Mighty Ducks</em> (1992)<br/> <em>Drop Dead Fred</em> (1991)<br/> <em>Freddy\u2019s Dead: The Final Nightmare</em> (1991)<br/> <em>What About Bob?</em> (1991)<br/> <em>Dick Tracy</em> (1990)<br/> <em>Die Hard 2: Die Harder</em> (1990)<br/> <em>Gremlins 2: The New Batch</em> (1990) Ah, the 1980s! If the 1970s invented the big ticket blockbuster, then this was the decade that perfected it! Any and every genre took part in the excitement too, as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2491200/things-that-dont-make-sense-about-die-hard\">action hits like <em>Die Hard</em></a> and comedy classics like <em>Twins</em> made big stars out of folks like Bruce Willis and made even bigger stars out of Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Meanwhile, movies like <em>Raising Arizona</em> showed the world that family could be a really funny, and kinda criminal, sort of heartwarming. Though if <em>Pretty In Pink</em> taught the world anything in its Brat Pack era rom-com, it's that you should tell the people you love just that. But if you happen to strike out, life has a way of working out after all. Things might be a bit too light and cheery for you right about now, and if that's the case, we'd like to round off our commentary on the '80s with one simple statement: horror rules! Nowhere was that more prevalent than in the Stanley Kubrick adaptation of <em>The Shining</em>, and Wes Craven's <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em>: two films that taught us that in the wrong circumstances, a mind is a terrible thing to bend. How do you not love the '80s with movies like these on the menu? <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child</em> (1989)<br/> <em>Lethal Weapon 2</em> (1989)<br/> <em>Pet Sematary</em> (1989)<br/> <em>Police Academy 6: City Under Siege</em> (1989)<br/> <em>Teen Witch</em> (1989)<br/> <em>The Wizard</em> (1989)<br/> <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master</em> (1988)<br/> <em>Big Top Pee Wee</em> (1988)<br/> <em>Die Hard</em> (1988)<br/> <em>Hairspray</em> (1988)<br/> <em>Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach</em> (1988)<br/> <em>The Land Before Time</em> (1988)<br/> <em>Twins</em> (1988)<br/> <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors</em> (1987)<br/> <em>Empire of the Sun</em> (1987)<br/> <em>Jaws: The Revenge</em> (1987)<br/> <em>Lethal Weapon</em> (1987)<br/> <em>Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol</em> (1987)<br/> <em>Raising Arizona</em> (1987)<br/> <em>The Witches of Eastwick</em> (1987)<br/> <em>Aliens</em> (1986)<br/> <em>Critters</em> (1986)<br/> <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em> (1986)<br/> <em>Police Academy 3: Back in Training</em> (1986)<br/> <em>Pretty in Pink</em> (1986)<br/> <em>A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy\u2019s Revenge</em> (1985)<br/> <em>Out of Africa</em> (1985)<br/> <em>Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment</em> (1985)<br/> <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> (1984)<br/> <em>Gremlins</em> (1984)<br/> <em>Police Academy</em> (1984)<br/> <em>Supergirl</em> (1984)<br/> <em>Jaws 3-D</em> (1983)<br/> <em>The Outsiders</em> (1983)<br/> <em>Blade Runner: The Final Cut</em> (1982)<br/> <em>Friday the 13th</em> (1980) We've reached the end of our time travel adventure in the HBO Max library, and this section is the one we might see fill out the most over time. While there's not a lot of movies included from the 1970s and decades previous, there's a vast library of classics that could migrate over from streaming predecessors like Filmstruck. As it stands right now though, there's still some impressive hardware included in the archives of Hollywood's golden ages. As part of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474862/alien-movie-timeline-explained-all-alien-movies-in-order-chronologically-and-by-release-date\">the entire franchise run</a> on HBO Max, Ridley Scott's <em>Alien: Director's Cut</em> will remind you that in space, no one can hear you scream. However, with Steven Spielberg's <em>Jaws</em>, you'll also learn that those rules don't apply in the open ocean, and pretty much everyone can hear you scream. Though, if you want to split the difference, Woody Allen's <em>Annie Hall</em> doesn't contain a lot of screaming, but it does shift between interior and exterior dialogue. So what you're hearing at any point is quite subjective. <em>Alien (Director\u2019s Cut)</em> (1979)<br/> <em>Apocalypse Now</em> (1979)<br/> <em>Jaws 2</em> (1978)<br/> <em>Piranha</em> (1978)<br/> <em>Annie Hall</em> (1977)<br/> <em>Jaws</em> (1975)<br/> <em>The Thomas Crown Affair</em> (1968)<br/> <em>Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</em> (1964)<br/> <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> (1939) In addition to the titles listed above being rolled out in the initial phases of HBO Max's lifespan, there's also a killer roster of narrative and documentary films and shorts coming online in June.

    "title": "Jurassic World 3: What We Know So Far About Dominion",
    "content": "It's been almost two years since <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em> captivated the imaginations of the entire planet, with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2442890/how-much-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-could-make-during-its-second-weekend\">big box office numbers</a> and an ending that got everybody talking. And yet before any of this had landed on fan's mental doorsteps for opening weekend, there was another sequel waiting in the wings, ready to take the stage once those closing moments played out. So naturally, now is the perfect time to start talking about the future installment in the series, <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>. While there\u2019s still a lot to learn at this particular moment, there's a good amount of information we do know, which we'll share here. But be warned, there will be some speculation based on the ending to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2443169/how-jurassic-world-2s-ending-references-jurassic-park\"><em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em></a>, and as soon as we have updated information, this guide will be refreshed to reflect it. For now though, let's dive into the future of what was once simply known as <em>Jurassic World 3</em>. Before <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em> was even released into the wild, a date was set for <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em> to take its place on the world stage. The film will be released theatrically on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2314982/jurassic-world-3-is-already-in-the-works\">June 11, 2021</a>. That's a pretty special date too, considering it's also the exact day that <em>Jurassic Park</em> opened in 1993, making this film the perfect 28th anniversary present for dinosaur fans. However, the competition will be pretty stiff, as <em>Jurassic World 3</em> will be pitted against Paramount\u2019s <em>Micronauts</em> film, which opens the week before it on June 4th, and an untitled Pixar film opening on June 18th. Two weeks later, the battle really begins when Warner Bros.\u2019 <em>The Batman</em> storms into theaters on June 25th. This is all assuming that <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em> manages to maintain this release date <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492595/jurassic-world-dominion-shuts-down-filming-here-how-much-money-coronavirus-breaks-are-costing\">after its postponed production schedule</a>, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It's most likely that <em>Jurassic World 3</em> will be rated PG-13, as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2440280/would-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-have-been-better-if-it-were-r-rated\">the whole series</a> has followed that pattern. The precedent goes all the way back to Steven Spielberg's original film, which balanced the heart of a family friendly blockbuster with the fierce nature of Michael Crichton's harsher, more terrifying source material. Both films in the series, <em>Jurassic World</em> and <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em>, were rated PG-13 for \"<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4881806/\">intense sequences of science-fiction violence and peril</a>.\" So unless the peril and violence become either scaled back, or more intense, expect more of the same. With such a quick release window approaching, <em>Jurassic World 3</em> obviously needs a story written before cameras can start shooting in the near future. As luck would have it, the film's script will be written by two writers. The first is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2314982/jurassic-world-3-is-already-in-the-works\">Emily Carmichael</a>, whose recent credits saw her name listed in connection to this year's <em>Pacific Rim: Uprising</em>, as well as a past re-write on Disney's remake of <em>The Black Hole</em>. The second is not a surprise, considering he's been working on the franchise since day one: Colin Trevorrow. After his indie success with <em>Safety Not Guaranteed,</em> Trevorrow was hired to direct and co-write <em>Jurassic World</em> with writing partner Derek Connolly. The two reteamed for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1686499/jurassic-world-2-everything-we-know-about-fallen-kingdom\"><em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em></a>, but now the team is broken in the name of progress. But Emily Carmichael will also be involved, adding another perspective. In keeping with the latest trend to bring back your first director to close out a trilogy, Colin Trevorrow, the director of <em>Jurassic World</em>, and co-writer both that film and <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em>, is back in the director's chair for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2395752/jurassic-world-3-has-hired-a-very-familiar-director\"><em>Jurassic World 3</em></a>. This is mostly because of his dismissal from the director's chair / writing room on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2431999/colin-trevorrow-finally-opens-up-about-departing-star-wars-episode-ix\"><em>Star Wars: Episode IX</em></a> which, along with his work on <em>The Book of Henry</em>, prevented him from returning to the series. Trevorrow didn't remain a complete stranger to the franchise though, as he not only co-wrote the sequel to his first effort, he also helped approve the hiring of J.A. Bayona on they film as well. While there are a lot of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2440650/12-major-questions-we-have-after-seeing-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom\">questions</a> that are left open at the end of <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em>, we're not sure which ones would be a priority when it comes to providing any answers in <em>Jurassic Park 3's</em> story. However, it can be assumed that this third, and possibly final, film in the <em>Jurassic World</em> franchise deals with rounding up the surviving dinosaurs scattered across the world. It's even a good bet to think that Claire and Owen will be trying to recover and relocate all of those creatures on the island that Eli Mills originally pitched as the supposed dinosaur sanctuary at the beginning of <em>Fallen Kingdom</em>. Most importantly, this should be the defining chapter of the story between Owen and Blue the Velociraptor, as her escape into the wild left the door wide open for a reunion in the future. Though as far as Colin Trevorrow is concerned, the following angle will be important to <em>Jurassic World 3</em>, per an interview with <a href=\"http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/22/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-burning-questions/\">EW</a>: As both <em>Jurassic World</em> and <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em> have used hybrid dinosaurs as their showstopping creations / partial antagonists, a third go 'round must have some audience members asking, 'how the hell are they going to top the Indominous Rex and Indoraptor creations?' Thankfully, whether that question was asked with a serious or derisive tone, an answer has already been made apparent. There will be <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2416091/jurassic-world-3-wont-include-any-hybrid-dinosaurs\">no hybrid dinosaur</a> in <em>Jurassic World 3</em>, per Colin Trevorrow's wishes to get back to basics with the dinos of the series, which is probably the best decision. Not only does this mean that folks will not be given the chance to get tired of hybrid dinosaurs, it fits perfectly with the ending in which all of the \"pure\" dinosaurs were <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2439330/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-ending---what-it-means-for-jurassic-world-3\">let into the wild</a>. At this point, the series doesn't need more species, especially if this film is supposed to wrap things up. Here's what we know about the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482815/jurassic-world-3-an-updated-cast-list-for-dominion\"><em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em> cast</a> of characters. A Navy vet turned animal behaviorist, Owen Grady was a crucial part of <em>Jurassic World's</em> operations, as he trained Blue and her Raptor Squad siblings for the park's benefit. Losing all but one of those Raptors in the events of the previous film, Grady took to building himself a cabin and living a quiet life. Then the events of <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em> happened, and once again, Owen was thrown into a nightmarish clash of dinosaurs, as he helped track, and eventually save, the dinosaurs of Isla Nublar. By the end of the new film, Owen is presumably reunited with his ex-girlfriend, Claire Dearing, and on good terms once more. Even more surprising is the fact that the two of them now have a child to watch after: Maisie Lockwood, the genetic clone of Benjamin Lockwood's daughter. Once a corporate figure in the pecking order at <em>Jurassic World</em>, Claire Dearing went from being a Masrani Global stooge obsessed with investors and attractions to a full blown dino supporter. Working with the Dinosaur Protection League in <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em>, Claire actually cares about the creatures she once profited off of, though in the end, she obviously knew that releasing dinosaurs into the wild was a bad idea. Unfortunately for her, Maisie Lockwood had other plans, as she hit the button to release the dinos into our world. With her new improvised family unit, comprising of she, Owen Grady, and Maisie, they will be venturing off into a world of dinosaur peril, and whatever else meets their path. A <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/jurassic-world-2-human-clone-twist-clues-explained/\">mysterious child</a> who roamed the estate of her supposed grandfather, Benjamin Lockwood, Maisie turned out to be someone completely different. She was revealed to be <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2441390/why-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-brought-in-that-big-twist-according-to-colin-trevorrow\">the cloned copy</a> of Lockwood's daughter, created after her genetic sources' untimely death in a car crash. Coming to terms with who she is, it was she that decided to release the dinosaurs into the wild, as Maisie felt that they deserved to live as much as she did. While there may be more secrets hiding in the shadows, the present seems peaceful as she's with Owen and Claire at the end of <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em>, and is presumed to be their responsibility still in <em>Jurassic World 3</em>. One of the connective threads between the <em>Jurassic Park</em> and <em>Jurassic World</em> franchises is expert geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Initially hired to help John Hammond realize the park of his dreams, Dr. Wu eventually became part of InGen and then Masrani Global's efforts to create the second, more successful bid at a viable theme park. And through each instance of dinosaur laden mayhem he's orbited, he's survived the fallout without a problem. That tradition still stands post <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2405651/what-bd-wong-is-actually-doing-in-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-according-to-new-trailer\"><em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em></a>, as the character portrayed by B.D. Wong doesn't die in the finale, and Colin Trevorrow has even stated in interviews that he feels the character's story isn't finished. In fact, he could always turn back to the side of good again, after witnessing what happened when he threw his lot in with inGen during <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em>. What's more, after reading that Wong sees the character as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2435719/bd-wong-explains-why-we-shouldnt-call-jurassic-world-fallen-kingdoms-dr-wu-a-villain\">a non-villainous presence</a>, there's a chance for redemption, even after Dr. Wu's turncoat past. Bred in captivity and part of the Raptor Squad that resided in <em>Jurassic World</em>, Blue the velociraptor retreated to the wilds of Isla Nublar when all was said and done with the Indominous Rex. Years later, through Owen Grady's assistance, the mercenaries hired by InGen eventually captured her for the purpose of using her DNA to refine the Indoraptor prototype, and give it a mother to raise it. After being set loose, and helping kill the Indoraptor prototype in <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em>, Blue ran off into the wild again, seemingly upset that she would wind up in a cage and taken somewhere unfamiliar yet again. We last saw her stumble on a housing development in the desert, so <em>Jurassic World 3</em> undoubtedly will see our favorite velociraptor possibly running into new and exciting humans in the near future. A paleoveterinarian who assisted Owen Grady and Claire Dearing in the retrieval, care, and eventual release of the dinosaurs from Isla Nublar in <em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em>, Zia Rodriguez is as tough as she is resourceful. Returning to the fold for <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>, not much is known of how actor Daniella Pineda\u2019s character will be playing into the further adventures of the franchise. If you thought Franklin Webb was frightened when the dinosaurs of <em>Jurassic World</em> were kept on one singular island, the man must be positively shocked in a world where prehistoric creature roams the earth freely. Justice Smith will be back to play Franklin again in <em>Jurassic World 3</em>, though much like his frequent scene partner, Daniella Pineda\u2019s Zia Rodriguez, we\u2019re not sure how he\u2019ll be instrumental to this brave new world of dinosaur action. Reaching further back in the cast roster of the <em>Jurassic World</em> saga, we\u2019ll be seeing two characters from Colin Trevorrow\u2019s previous entry as director coming to the forefront of things again. Fellow Velociraptor trainer and former InGen employee Barry Semb\u00e8ne, played by actor Omar Sy in <em>Jurassic World</em>, is now coming back for <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>, as well as with another close co-star from that very same film. When we last saw Lowery Cruthers, he released a Tyrannosaurus Rex into <em>Jurassic World</em>, upon orders from Claire Dearing, in order to fight off the scourge known as the Indominous Rex. <em>Jurassic World 3</em> has no concrete plans as to how it\u2019ll be using Lowery\u2019s technical knowhow. Though here\u2019s hoping he\u2019ll know better than to hesitate when someone asks for a dinosaur assist. The last grouping of characters that we know are coming back for a fact in <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em> are, of course, the classic trio that made <em>Jurassic Park</em> an adventure 65 billion years in the making! As he was the only one to return for a role in the <em>Jurassic World</em> franchise, Dr. Ian Malcolm has a head start on his fellow veterans in dinosaur adventure. Jeff Goldblum will be playing this role yet again, making his fourth appearance in the <em>Jurassic</em> franchise overall. Returning for the first time since <em>Jurassic Park III</em>, Sam Neill\u2019s Dr. Alan Grant may or may not have had some tussles with Velociraptors after his initial adventure on Isla Nublar. That would depend on whether <em>Jurassic World 3</em> consider its equally numbered predecessor as a canon adventure or not. Which means Dr. Grant\u2019s personal history with our last returning <em>Jurassic Park</em> star may have changed drastically since we last saw them together. Dr. Ellie Sattler, played by the ever iconic Laura Dern, is <em>Jurassic World 3\u2019s</em> final returning legacy character; and not a moment too soon. With <em>Jurassic World</em> cast mates like Bryce Dallas Howard clamoring for her return, the <em>Little Women</em> star is back to help understand just how prehistoric creatures may or may not interact with the flora and fauna of the modern world. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if her <em>Jurassic Park III</em> marriage is still canonically intact, or if we\u2019ll see a new rendition of her character in play. Believe it or not, for as many returning characters as <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em> has introduced us to in these early days, there are still some new cast members that are complete enigmas as to who they\u2019ll be playing or what they\u2019ll be doing. Fresh off of a role in Netflix\u2019s <em>Altered Carbon</em>, Dichen Lachman has been added to the cast of <em>Jurassic World 3</em> in an undisclosed capacity. That same \u201cundisclosed capacity\u201d goes for Scott Haze, best known to the world as <em>Venom\u2019s</em> Roland Treese, actor Scott Haze. While Haze is also part of <em>Jurassic World: Dominion\u2019s</em> box of surprise players, it wouldn\u2019t be that much of a stretch to imagine him playing some sort of InGen commando just waiting to take down some dinosaurs in the field of battle. Actor Mamoudou Athie has been making a name for himself in ensembles for films like <em>Patti Cake$</em> and <em>The Front Runner</em>, with a recently successful bid as a leading man in Netflix\u2019s recent original movie <em>Uncorked</em>. Now poised to jump into the world of blockbusters, Athie has become a part of <em>Jurassic World\u2019s</em> casting family, in a role we have absolutely no clue about to this day. Though Michael Crichton fans might indulge in some wishful thinking and suggest that maybe we\u2019ll finally see R.B. \u201cArby\u201d Benton from the novel version of <em>The Lost World</em> being brought to life. If Arby is coming to the big screen, then chances are we just might see fellow <em>Lost World</em> character Kelly Curtis, also known as Ian Malcolm\u2019s daughter, working her way into <em>Jurassic World: Dominion\u2019s</em> \u201ccelebration\u201d of everything Jurassic. Which could mean that the casting of <em>She\u2019s Gotta Have It</em> star DeWanda Wise might be another piece in the puzzle that links <em>Jurassic Park</em> to <em>Jurassic World</em>. But again, this is speculation, as no character info has been provided at this time. <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em> is slated for release on June 11, 2021; but should this or any other factor change, we\u2019ll update this guide accordingly as that information breaks.

    "title": "Indiana Jones 5: What We Know So Far",
    "content": "It was only <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2442920/indiana-jones-5-may-have-taken-a-big-step-forward\">a matter of time</a> before Indiana Jones whipped himself into shape to swing back onto the big screen for another major movie spectacle. It's been 11 years since <em>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</em> made its way into theaters around the world, and it is safe to say that the fourth film is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481371/indiana-jones-movies-ranked-from-worst-to-best\">not everyone's favorite installment</a>. Hopefully, whenever <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> inevitably comes along, it'll serve as a more fitting finale for one of the most beloved characters in cinematic history. For now, however, let's take a look at what we know about Indiana Jones' <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2447759/indiana-jones-5-has-been-pushed-back-again\">long-promised sequel.</a> Details are obviously very limited when it comes to this new installment. But ever since plans were announced regarding a fifth <em>Indiana Jones</em> movies, there have been some tidbits and small nuggets of information that give us an idea of what we might expect for this brand-new blockbuster sequel. This is the million dollar question when it comes to <em>Indiana Jones 5</em>. The sequel was first announced around 2016, but <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2300642/indiana-jones-5-may-be-delayed-heres-what-we-know\">it has been delayed</a> several times by now, and the release date keeps getting pushed back in the process. Understandably, everyone is busy and nobody wants to make a sequel that's below their usual standards. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull\">Not again, at least</a>.) So, for now, <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> is set to be released on July 9th, 2021. But, it's hard to know for sure if this release date will stick. It's ultimately a matter of whether or not the filmmakers and the actors involved can make it work in a timely fashion. Indiana Jones wouldn't be the same without Steven Spielberg at the helm. The Academy Award-winning director has led all four movies to date, and it sounds like <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> will be no exception. He is currently attached to direct the latest sequel in the ever-growing franchise, though when he'll get a chance to call the shots is unclear. He's currently in post-production in his latest movie, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476017/why-you-should-be-very-excited-for-steven-spielbergs-west-side-story-remake\">2020's remake of <em>West Side Story</em></a>, but the world-famous filmmaker is known to make more than one movie at a time. Currently, Spielberg is attached to direct <em>The Kidnapping Of Edgardo Mortara</em>, as well as any number of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/642469/Upcoming-Steven-Spielberg-Movies-Indiana-Jones-5-Ready-Player-One-More\">other movies that pique his interest</a>, but if Disney can convince him to do <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> first, that will really help to get the ball rolling. When it comes to the writing process for Indiana Jones 5, it's admittedly a bit of a free-for-all. Earlier in the process, David Koepp, who wrote <em>Indiana</em> <em>Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</em>, was attached to write the screenplay. But, it was later announced that it was Jonathan Kasdan, the screenwriter for <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em> alongside his father, Lawrence Kasdan, who have a hand in shaping up the script. Before that, it was revealed that <em>A Quiet Place</em> screenwriters Scott Beck and Bryan Woods were being sought out for either this project or a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie. It was then revealed that producer Frank Marshall was assembling a bit of a \"writer's room\" to collect ideas. It was then rumored that Dan Fogelman had written a new script. Therefore, things are a bit murky when it comes to the screenplay process, which likely explains why the production start date keeps getting pushed back. You need a great idea and a good script to keep everyone jazzed about the process, and Frank Marshall and his team are still trying to fine tune things from a writing standpoint before the cameras can start rolling. Once more official details regarding the script are confirmed, we'll be sure to let you know. According to speculation, Jonathan Kasdan's screenplay, which reportedly revolved around the Walbrzych Nazi gold train, has been thrown out. It was also reported in September that David Koepp <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480719/well-heres-some-hopeful-news-about-indiana-jones-5\">is supposedly back on board</a> to write the screenplay, and he claims that he has \"a good idea\" for it. Among one of the most famous and memorable aspects of the <em>Indiana Jones</em> franchise is the iconic score. It's easily one of the most instantly recognizable components of the film series; can you imagine an <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie without that famous tune playing? Of course not! Therefore, it's practically a no-brainer that John Williams has been asked to return for another <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie. It was revealed by Steven Spielberg that he agreed to return. While <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> is several months (or maybe even years) away from receiving an official MPAA rating, there's little doubt that this newest sequel will receive a PG-13 rating. While <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</em> carried PG ratings, the franchise has always had a bit of a dark edge, particularly with the grisly and violent deaths of some nasty foes, and it was ultimately Steven Spielberg who championed for the inclusion of a PG-13 rating back in 1984. As <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/indiana-jones-and-the-temple-of-doom-created-pg-13-rating-2014-4\">Business Insider</a> notes, it was mainly because of <em>Temple of Doom</em>, specifically, that Spielberg himself felt it was necessary for the ratings board to add a new rating, either PG-13 or PG-14, that would serve as a bridge between PG and R inside their system. Since then, both <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</em> have carried PG-13 ratings, and there's very little reason to doubt that <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> will also receive this distinction. It's unlikely that Steven Spielberg should tone the series back down to PG, especially by modern standards, and there's very, very little reason to believe that <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> will be released under Disney with an R rating. Therefore, it's more likely than not that <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> \u2014 whenever it makes it way onto the screen \u2014 will promptly receive another PG-13 rating for the franchise. Ever since it was announced that <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> would be coming to a theater near you, it has been hard to determine when exactly production is expected to begin. There were initial claims that production would start in 2019, with April, specifically, being cited at one point and the thought being that the production ball would roll in the United Kingdom. With the year almost over, that's unlikely to be the case. Since then, the estimated production start date has shifted to mid-2020, with later reports claiming April 2020 is the expected start of shooting. It's hard to know for sure whether or not that April 2020 projection is expected to come true. Although, there's reason to believe that, between then and now, Steven Spielberg could be wrapping up post-production duties on <em>West Side Story</em> while he begins pre-production responsibilities on <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> in early 2020. That would also depend on whether there is any sort of finalized script in place, which is currently unclear. For now, though, that's when the production is expected to begin. Particularly if they want to meet their expected 2021 release date. Don't be surprised if that date gets delayed, though... Since 2016, it has been confirmed that Harrison Ford will reprise his role as Indiana Jones in this fourth sequel. After all, what would Indiana Jones be without the A-list actor in the title role? Certainly not your typical <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie, that's for sure. Because the actor isn't getting any younger, as the release date and production start date keep getting pushed back, there's the understandable question of what is going to happen when Ford is simply too old to play the part. At the moment, it appears that's not too deep of a concern, as Ford is on-board, though <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2472223/harrison-ford-has-very-blunt-opinions-about-the-future-of-indiana-jones\">he cast some doubt earlier</a>. While Harrison Ford is the only cast member who is currently confirmed to star in the upcoming movie, there's good reason to believe that Karen Allen <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462660/what-karen-allen-knows-about-indiana-jones-5\">will also return</a> for this sequel, especially since (spoiler alert) Marion Ravenwood married Indy at the end of <em>Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</em> It'd be weird if she didn't make a return. In any case, whether or not Muff Williams (Shia LaBeouf) will return is totally unclear. Good money suggests that he will not be in the new movie, but there are some claims that Chris Pratt will be appearing in the new <em>Indiana Jones</em> sequel, though <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2461162/harrison-ford-updates-on-indiana-jones-5-chris-pratts-involvement\">that is not yet confirmed</a>. Dr. Henry Walton \"Indiana\" Jones, Jr. has served as the main protagonist and action hero avatar at the forefront of four <em>Indiana Jones</em> movies. Created as a homage to the action stars of serials found in the 1930s, the famous character, played dutifully by Harrison Ford, is a professor of archaeology at Yale University. He might spend his days teaching about the wonders of the world, but he is often out trying to discover great lost artifacts throughout the world. As the character has grown older, he has also grown from an adventure-friendly man who is afraid of commitment (and snakes) to someone who has matured and accepted the responsibilities of getting older and settling down. He's still afraid of snakes, however. Some things do not change. When George Lucas signed off his company, Lucasfilm, to Disney, along with all of the IP found therein, the famous director/producer began living a much quieter life, watching his famous properties continue to thrive <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480828/bob-iger-explains-why-george-lucas-was-disappointed-with-the-force-awakens\">while he retains little creative influence</a>. When it was announced that <em>Indiana Jones 5</em> was underway, many people thought it would be similar to the recent <em>Star Wars</em> movies, where Lucas is kept at bay. According to Steven Spielberg, however, Lucas <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2477226/george-lucas-gave-jon-favreau-solid-advice-for-the-mandalorian\">is still involved in the process</a>. He will serve as an executive producer, and he'll continue to oversee the property. As Spielberg said, it would be \"insane,\" in his view, to make an <em>Indiana Jones</em> film without him. After all, George Lucas has remained the main catalyst for the film franchise. This is what we know so far about <em>Indiana Jones 5</em>, but there are certainly going to be more updates in the future. Stay tuned for more developments.

    "title": "John Wick Chapter 4: What We Know So Far",
    "content": "Keanu Reeves came back in a major way with 2014's <em>John Wick</em>, thus spawning one of the most unlikely action franchises of the current decade. The third installment, <em>John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2014 Parabellum</em>, became one of the most critically acclaimed, as well as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480723/keanu-rules-john-wick-3-gave-studio-best-home-release-in-five-years\">one of the most financially successful</a>, entrees in the series yet. Therefore, it should come as no surprise to learn that <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em> is right around the corner \u2014 locked and loaded. There are plans for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481813/the-john-wick-spinoff-has-finally-taken-a-big-step-forward\">a spin-off</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471958/how-john-wick-3-set-up-a-possible-spinoff\">two,</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471607/theres-a-john-wick-video-game-in-the-works\">a video game,</a> a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2477196/john-wicks-spinoff-series-the-continental-will-be-a-prequel\">television show prequel</a> centered around The Continental Hotel and a possible <em>Atomic Blonde</em> crossover with Charlize Theron (as reported by <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/atomic-blonde-john-wick-crossover/\">ScreenRant</a>), in addition to this new sequel. Therefore, fans shouldn't be missing out on any <em>John Wick</em>-related goodness in the years to come. For now, though, let's take a look at what we know about the upcoming <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em>. Details are obviously limited, especially since it is not even in pre-production yet. But, we'll tell you everything we know about the exciting sequel, and why you should be thrilled for Wick's return. <em>John Wick: Chapter 2</em> came out a little under three years after its original. Subsequently, <em>John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2014 Parabellum</em> was released a little over two years after its predecessor. Keeping in this tradition, it has been announced that <em>John Wick</em> fans won't have to wait terribly long before John Wick is back on the big screen. As it was reported by <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/john-wick-4-summer-2021-lionsgate-1203221620/\">Variety,</a> the newest <em>John Wick</em> movie is set to be released on May 21, 2021. That's almost exactly two years after the third movie, and that's very good news for action movie lovers. Particularly after <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2472197/john-wick-3-is-there-more-to-that-ending-twist-than-meets-the-eye\">the explosive cliffhanger</a> at <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471907/john-wick-chapter-3-ending-what-happens-and-what-it-means-for-the-next-chapter\">the end of the latest movie</a>. While it hasn't been confirmed at this time, there's very good reason to believe that director Chad Stahelski will return to helm the latest sequel. The former stuntman-turned-action filmmaker co-directed the original <em>John Wick</em> alongside an uncredited David Leitch (<em>Deadpool 2</em>, <em>Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw</em>), and he took over solo directing duties for both <em>John Wick: Chapter 2</em> and <em>John Wick: Chapter 3 \u2014 Parabellum</em>. There's little doubt that, when it comes time to shoot this newest installment, Stahelski will return to the director's chair. The blockbuster filmmaker noted in a Reddit AMA <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/booyih/hey_im_director_chad_stahelski_lets_talk_about/enits57/\">back in May</a> that he would be involved with a fourth film should the third movie be successful. Clearly, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475931/john-wick-3-broke-even-more-box-office-milestones-this-weekend\">that was the case here</a>. At the moment, nobody is officially confirmed to appear in <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em>. It's still in the very, very early stages; they might not have anything resembling a finished script yet \u2014 let alone the casting deals sorted out. But it would hard to imagine a <em>John Wick</em> movie without Keanu Reeves. He echoed the statement made by director Chad Stahelski earlier in May when <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/the-legend-of-keanu-reeves\">the veteran actor said</a> that he would gladly be involved with a fourth <em>John Wick</em> movie if the third one was a hit. Thankfully, that was definitely the case. And, we can assume a few other familiar faces will return too. Based on the final cliffhanger at the end of <em>John Wick: Chapter 3</em>, one could assume that Laurence Fishburne will be returning to work on the latest sequel. Similarly, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, and possibly Halle Berry, John Leguizamo, Asia Kate Dillion, Jason Mantzoukas and Angelica Huston will make their returns to the franchise. But, at the moment, nobody is officially signed on to appear in the sequel, though that will likely change soon. It should come as no surprise that <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em> will quite certainly be rated R. There is a very, very, <em>very</em> small chance that the currently-unmade movie might pull an <em>Expendables 3</em> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Sylvester-Stallone-Explains-Why-Expendables-3-PG-13-43074.html\">release a PG-13 sequel,</a> but it's highly doubtful. The <em>John Wick</em> franchise is known for its quick, cutting violence, and the third movie was easily the most grizzly and graphic sequel in the series to date. It would be shocking if they decided to make the next one anything but a hard R. After all, they gotta up the ante with each movie, and there's a good chance that the fourth film is gonna get very violent. As mentioned earlier, <em>John Wick</em> became one of the most unlikely action movie franchises of the past few years. It has grown from a small $20 million action flick into one of the biggest, most expensive and elaborate cinematic franchises in Hollywood. Audiences are clearly hungry for more, and they are happy to know that <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em> is coming around the corner in just a little over a year. How far will this franchise go, though? It's hard to say for sure, and director Chad Stahelski admits in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/john-wick-3-director-chad-stahelski-franchise-future-1202130369/\">Indiewire</a> that he and Keanu Reeves plan each movie one step at a time, trying not to get ahead of themselves thinking about the future. But, it sounds like Stahelski has a pessimistic view when it comes to the future of the title character. While it's hard to know for sure whether or not <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em> will be the conclusive installment in the ever-growing action franchise, it doesn't sound like the filmmakers have any plans for giving this character any sense of peace throughout his extensive, ongoing troubles. He's a marked man, someone who has chosen a dangerous profession where you don't necessarily win or loose. Rather, you either live to see another day or die trying. It is not a happy life, and it doesn't sound like there is any sort of harmony to be found in John Wick's final moments \u2014 whenever those might arrive. For now, however, Chad Stahelski, Keanu Reeves and everyone else will seemingly ride the train as far as it'll go \u2014 even if the end point is bleak. All that said, though, it sounds like Keanu Reeves is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471453/keanu-reeves-reveals-his-ideal-john-wick-ending\">a lot more hopeful and optimistic</a> about what might happen during John Wick's final sequence. It should also be noted that Stahelski said back in late 2018 that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464029/john-wick-director-wants-to-continue-the-franchise-indefinitely\">he would like to continue this series</a> \"indefinitely,\" so there are no plans to slow down. As mentioned earlier in this article, in addition to <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em>, there are also plans to make a spin-off movie placed inside the <em>John Wick</em> universe titled <em>Ballerina</em>. The movie was initially announced back in July 2017, a few months after <em>John Wick: Chapter Two</em> stormed into theaters. At that time, there were only slow developments, but it jumped into action earlier this year when it was announced that Len Wiseman (<em>Underworld</em>, <em>Live Free Or Die Hard</em>) was attached to direct, along with Keanu Reeves and Chad Stahelski on-board as a producer and executive producer, respectively. At the moment, we have more details about <em>Ballerina</em> than we do <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em>. For instance, we know that it'll focus on a young woman who is raised to become an assassin, seeking the men who killed her family. And, it's set to be written by Shay Hatten, who was previously a writer's assistant for Team Downey. Unlike <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em>, there is no publicly announced release date, so it is hard to know whether or not it's set to come out either before or after <em>Chapter 4</em>. Nevertheless, if a director is attached and the pieces are starting to come together, it wouldn't be out of the question to see the spin-off movie in the next year or two. If that's the case, then we can probably expect at least a nod or two to either the upcoming <em>John Wick</em> movie in <em>Ballerina</em>, or for the story told in <em>Ballerina</em> to be referenced in <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em>, particularly with <em>Chapter 3</em> providing our introduction to this new spin-off film. Expect more details to follow. Born Jardani Jovonovich, John Wick, played by the one-and-only Keanu Reeves, is one of the most deadly and legendary assassins known to man in the world of the <em>John Wick</em> franchise. Once a U.S. Marine turned wealthy (and damn near untouchable) assassin, Wick opted out of the world of killing people for a living, until a couple of no-good punks invaded his house, stole his car and unjustly killed his dog. From there, Wick is out for vengeance. He will stop at nothing until everyone who did him wrong is killed. Wick tried to readjust to life on his own afterwards, but he's brought back into the field for a favor that needs repaying. Then, everything snowballed into anarchy as John is killing people left-and-right, trying to save his own life. It's a franchise that refers back to some of Keanu Reeves' previous movies, as well as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481596/john-wick-4-times-the-franchise-referenced-the-matrix-and-other-action-movies\">other action classics</a>, and it is an exhilarating thrill ride of a franchise that should hopefully continue to provide no shortage of entertaining and incredible stunts and action sequences galore with the fourth installment. For now, though, this is all we know about <em>John Wick: Chapter 4</em>. Let us know if you're excited to see John live to fight another day in the comments.

    "title": "Marvel's Eternals: What We Know So Far",
    "content": "<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476204/what-we-want-to-see-from-marvel-studios-at-comic-con\">At this year's Comic Con panel</a>, Marvel formally announced that <em>The Eternals</em> was one of several big-budget movies set to come out in their newly-announced Phase 4. While there were a few bits of information out about the film prior to this announcement, including Angelina Jolie's involvement, this is the first time we got any firm details on what we can now expect from this newest addition in the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe. And, while there are only a handful of updates made available about the film at this time, as Marvel has been vigilant about keeping information secret from the public, <em>The Eternals</em> is shaping up to be one of Marvel's most <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2458757/why-the-eternals-movie-could-be-important-for-marvel-after-avengers-4\">intriguing and hopefully promising new movies</a>, particularly when it comes to their new slate of movies after the climatic <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. We can't confirm everything about this blockbuster at this time (there are even some folks who aren't entirely clear if the title is <em>The Eternals</em> or simply <em>Eternals</em>), but we can report on what we know for sure about this new film and we can provide details that will hopefully get you excited to see what Marvel has to offer with one of their latest movies \u2014 especially <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467461/when-marvels-eternals-movie-could-be-set-according-to-kevin-feige\">at the start of this newest Phase</a>. At the aforementioned Comic-Con panel, it was revealed that <em>The Eternals</em> was officially set to be released on <strong>November 6th, 2020</strong>. That's certainly a tight window between now and then, with a little over a year before this blockbuster is set to screen in front of audiences everywhere. But, the film has reportedly been in pre-production since March of this year, and it sounds like <em>The Eternals</em> is already in the thick of preparations so that it can gear up for production. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477249/marvels-shang-chi-and-the-legend-of-the-ten-rings-what-we-know-so-far?pv=search\">As we have noted earlier,</a> production on <em>The Eternals</em> was already expected to begin no later than in the next few months. And, <a href=\"https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/07/24/marvels-eternals-first-look-set-photos-mcu/\">ComicBook.com</a> reported that the production appears to have already begun in the early stages, with sets being built in Buckinghamshire, England, which is where the blockbuster was rumored to begin filming a few months ago. With pre-production now underway, this would mean that <em>The Eternals</em> is shooting around the same time as <em>Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings</em>, which is scheduled to be released only a few short months later, in February 2021. The pre-production work for <em>The Eternals</em> reportedly started around late July. Clearly, this movie will film for at least the next few months before post-production fully gears up. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2458052/marvels-eternals-movie-just-took-a-big-step-forward\">In September 2018</a>, it was revealed that Chloe Zhao would be at the helm of <em>The Eternals</em>. The Chinese filmmaker already earned a wealth of acclaim for her sophomore feature, <em>The Rider</em>, which appeared on a number of top 10 lists last year. Zhao was also in the running to direct <em>Black Widow</em> before the position was given to Cate Shortland. But, it's clear that producer Kevin Feige and the rest of the folks over at Marvel were impressed with the director's work and they wanted to bring her on-board to helm one of their latest superhero blockbusters. This, even though the rising filmmaking talent has only made independent films to date, including her feature directorial debut, <em>Songs My Brothers Taught Me</em>, which came out only a few years earlier. Certainly, <em>The Eternals</em> is a big leap for Chloe Zhao, but she has acquired an exceptional cast for her latest film (which we'll discuss in just a little while) and it's clear that Marvel has a lot of confidence in this young filmmaker to prove herself in a major way with this latest film. It is also worth noting that <em>The Eternals</em> will now be the third Marvel film directed by a female filmmaker, following this year's <em>Captain Marvel</em> and the upcoming <em>Black Widow</em>. That is certainly an exciting development, and it's hopefully a sign of what's to come with regards to a diversity of filmmakers directing these movies. In May of 2018, it was revealed that cousins Ryan and Matthew K. Firpo were in talks to write the screenplay for <em>The Eternals</em>. The related writers have only previously had their short film screenplays brought to life, which makes the prospect of them jumping on board to write this major motion picture all the more exciting. Although, it should be noted that their script for the war thriller <em>Ruin</em> has acquired a great deal of interest \u2014 most notably because Margot Robbie and Matthias Schoenaerts are currently attached to star. Production for that film has been slow, so there's a chance that <em>The Eternals</em> might make it to the screen before this project gets off the ground. But, it's apparent that Kevin Feige and his team are impressed by these two writers. Created by Jack Kirby in 1976, The Eternals are a band of humanoids who were considered an offshoot of the evolutionary process which created sentinent life inside the Marvel universe. They were once intended to be the protectors of Earth, and they've gone to war with their counterparts, The Deviants. They are basically superhumans, unaffected by cold and heat and they can live for thousands of years without threat of disease or easy destruction. They've got a mental bond that prevents them from being seriously/fatally hurt, and they're capable of extraordinary feats like mind reading and flight. In short, they're basically the best of the best, in many respects. Although they do have some limitations (obviously), which will likely be explored in this film. They have several years of history, but it sounds like the characters chosen to be at the forefront of this introductory tale range from a variety of generations, with some characters arriving from the first generation, the third generation, the fifth generation and several others. It's unclear how closely this story will follow the origins of the characters from the comics, or when we'll be introduced to the characters with respect to the current timeline of the MCU. It has been confirmed that Angelina Jolie will play Thena, one of the genetically-engineered crime-fighters in the titular Eternals. She was <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2469044/marvels-the-eternals-is-adding-angelina-jolie\">the first person to be cast in the film</a>, which was considered a bit of a surprise. The actress has focused less on acting and more on directing and producing in recent years, with the exception of <em>Maleficent: Mistress of Evil</em>, which is expected to be released in the fall. Jolie also has other upcoming projects, including Taylor Sheridan's <em>Those Who Wish Me Dead</em> and Brenda Chapman's <em>Come Away</em>, both of which are expected to be released later this year or sometime next year. So, it does like she's decided to step back into acting a bit. Even though Jolie keeps herself busy in both her professional and personal life, she found the time to join the MCU. Actor and comedian Kumail Nanjiani has kept himself exceptionally busy in the last few years, and now <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2469895/kumail-nanjiani-may-be-joining-marvels-the-eternals\">he's set to star</a> in <em>The Eternals</em> in the role of Kingo. Ever since breaking out on television with <em>Silicon Valley</em> and at the cinema with <em>The Big Sick</em>, a semi-autobiographical dramedy he also co-wrote, the actor has been working on a variety of different projects for screens both big and small. He was recently seen in <em>Men in Black: International</em> and <em>Stuber</em>, along with an early episode of CBS All Access' reboot of <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, and he recently filmed the final season of <em>Silicon Valley,</em> which is expected to debut next year. Nanjiani also did another voiceover role for <em>The Voyage of Doctor Dolittle</em> and he starred in <em>The Lovebirds</em>, both of which are expected to be released next year. This is another huge role for the up-and-coming talent, and it continues his ascension to Hollywood's high ranks. Earlier this summer, it was revealed that Salma Hayek was being considered for a role in <em>The Eternals</em>. This information was confirmed at Comic-Con when she was announced as one part of the ensemble. The actress is set to play the role of Ajak, and it will be fun to see Hayek in another high-profile role. The actress has proven her action chops in the past, notably with her work in <em>Desperado</em>, <em>Once Upon A Time in Mexico</em> and, most recently, <em>The Hitman's Bodyguard</em>. Hayek is also set to appear in the sequel <em>The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard</em>, which is expected to come out next year. Even though the actress has proven herself throughout multiple genres and in a variety of films, <em>The Eternals</em> will be one of her biggest projects yet. In addition to the actors and actresses mentioned above, <em>The Eternals</em> is also expected to star <em>Games of Thrones</em>' Richard Madden, <em>The Walking Dead</em>'s Lauren Ridloff, <em>Atlanta</em>'s Brian Tyree Henry and Don Lee. They'll each be playing Ikaris, Makkari, Phastos, and Gilgamesh, respectively. <em>The</em> <em>Eternals</em> is also expected to star Lia McHugh as Sprite, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477638/the-eternals-may-be-casting-a-captain-marvel-actor-to-play-a-different-character\">it was recently announced</a> that Gemma Chan and the great young actor Barry Keoghan have reportedly joined the cast as well, although their roles have not been confirmed at this time. Clearly, it's shaping up to be a tremendous cast. As we said before, there are still a lot of details left unclear about <em>The Eternals</em> at this time. But with the release date fast approaching (even if it's still over a year away), we should expect to see and hear more about this film and these characters in the months to come. For now, however, this is the extent of what we know about this new blockbuster, and we'll continue to keep you posted on the details here at CinemaBlend, so be sure to bookmark this guide for all updates!

    "title": "Black Widow: What We Know So Far",
    "content": "After more than a decade in existence, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is ready to launch a whole new era. While building upon what has already been established, the upcoming Phase 4 will expand the franchise in new and exciting ways, and a big part of that is giving solo movies to characters who have never gotten them before. As it turns out, this includes Scarlett Johansson\u2019s Black Widow, who will soon be seen in her own big screen adventure. But what can we expect from a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2476936/black-widow\"><em>Black Widow</em></a> movie? Who is responsible for making it? When will it be set? What other characters will be appearing? There are hundreds of questions currently surrounding the project \u2013 but that\u2019s why we\u2019ve built this guide. Based on announcements, news stories, and interviews, we\u2019ve collected all of the information that we know about the developing blockbuster, and included it here for you in an easy-to-read format. So, without further ado, here\u2019s what we know about <em>Black Widow</em> so far: It's common practice for studios to release trailers for the biggest films of the forthcoming year in December, and that's the exact move that Marvel Studios pulled in delivering <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485901/thrilling-black-widow-trailer-is-action-packed-and-shows-off-taskmaster\">the debut trailer</a> for <em>Black Widow</em>. The first ever footage from the blockbuster was <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476874/black-widow-comic-con-footage-shows-off-amazing-action-and-taskmaster\">shown at San Diego Comic-Con</a> in July 2019, and that was followed up with new material at the D23 Expo in August 2019 \u2013 but while none of that material officially made its way online, you can enjoy the official look at the next chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by clicking play on the video embed below! With <em>Spider-Man: Far From Home</em> closing out Phase 3 and providing a comedown from the insanity of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe will kick off in 2020, and <em>Black Widow</em> will be the first title released as part of the announced slate. It will be one of only two Marvel Studios releases in the calendar year, set to be followed by <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2476930/eternals\"><em>The Eternals</em></a> in November, and is currently on the theatrical schedule for <strong>May 1, 2020</strong>. It has been officially confirmed that R-rated Marvel Cinematic Universe releases are on the horizon, as it\u2019s been promised that Deadpool will eventually be integrated into the franchise with the same limited boundaries he enjoyed as part of Fox\u2019s <em>X-Men</em> world. That\u2019s still years away from happening, though, and it definitely won\u2019t be <em>Black Widow</em> that begins the new era. Despite rumors to the contrary, the blockbuster will not be the first MCU title to hit theaters with a restricted grading from the MPAA, and will instead be PG-13 just like all of the other movies to date that have featured Scarlett Johansson\u2019s titular character. When it comes to choosing directors for projects, Marvel Studios clearly doesn\u2019t care much about filmmakers having past blockbuster experience. After all, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1459759/Guardians-Galaxy\">James Gunn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1465219/avengers-endgame\">Joe and Anthony Russo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1464069/Thor-Ragnarok\">Taika Waititi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1465189/Black-Panther/\">Ryan Coogler</a>, and more didn\u2019t have any prior to working on their respective Marvel projects, and they're responsible for some of the best films in the franchise. What Marvel is really interested in is storytellers and unique approaches, and so that\u2019s why they brought in Cate Shortland to take the helm of <em>Black Widow</em>. To date the Australian director has made three features \u2013 2004's <em>Somersault</em>, 2012's <em>Lore</em>, and 2017's <em>Berlin Syndrome</em> \u2013 and while none of them are action-driven spy thrillers, the comic book movie company clearly trusts her to operate well in the genre. Marvel Studios has not yet revealed an full plot description explaining what <em>Black Widow</em> will be about, but certain details have been gleaned from the footage that we've seen thus far, and various interviews with the cast and filmmakers. It has been confirmed that the movie will take place between the events of <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> and <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> (which isn\u2019t too big a surprise given that the eponymous hero died in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>). Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow will be an international fugitive at the start of the story, having violated the Sokovia Accords, and the adventure will take her to Budapest, Hungary, where she will be forced to confront demons from her past \u2013 including a reunion with her former colleagues in the spy community. Black Widow has been a key player in the Marvel Cinematic Universe from nearly the beginning, first brought to the big screen by Scarlett Johansson in 2010\u2019s <em>Iron Man 2</em> (a.k.a. the third movie in the franchise). She has been a massively important supporting character in seven blockbusters to date, with each adventure providing audiences a few more pieces of her troubled past, but with her first solo adventure we\u2019ll now have the chance to do a deep dive. We don\u2019t fully know what to expect, as Marvel is being incredibly secretive as usual, but what\u2019s revealed may wind up totally changing the way in which we reflect on the heroine going into the future of the canon. Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America is obviously a very special hero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but he was far from the only super soldier created in hopes of advancing a singular country\u2019s interest. The Russians have a hero of their own named The Red Guardian, and not only will he be making his live-action debut in <em>Black Widow</em>, but he will be <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2469369/the-black-widow-movie-has-added-stranger-things-david-harbour\">played by <em>Stranger Things</em> star David Harbour</a>. In the comics Red Guardian is at one point the husband of Natasha Romanoff, but based on what we have seen, he appears to be more of a father figure. Based on the footage we've seen, it also looks like the character will start the story in prison \u2013 which could mean that the film will feature some kind of prison break sequence. With her roles in <em>Fighting With My Family</em>, <em>Midsommar</em>, and <em>Little Women</em> in 2019, Florence Pugh has quickly established herself as a new \u201cit\u201d girl, and Marvel Studios acted fast in getting her a part in their expansive franchise. Specifically, she will be playing Yelena Belova, who is another Russian spy who went through similar training to Natasha Romanoff, and also carries the Black Widow mantle in the comics. It would seem that the two characters have a good amount of conflict-filled history, as a bone-crunching bout breaks out between them mere seconds after they reunite, but ultimately it looks like they will be fighting on the same side during the adventure. While most of the characters we know about in <em>Black Widow</em> have a comic book counterpart, Mason remains a bit of a mystery to fans. It was confirmed at San Diego Comic-Con 2019 that <em>Handmaid\u2019s Tale</em> star O-T Fagbenle will be playing the part, and it was noted that he is both an ally of Black Widow\u2019s and a wannabe love interest, but no real details beyond those have been revealed just yet. It\u2019s possible that Marvel is keeping a tight lid on things because of some kind of big secret, but we won\u2019t actually know if that\u2019s the case until May 2020. It is certainly noteworthy that the character doesn't seem to appear in the debut trailer. Marvel Studios has done an ace job getting <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470145/marvels-phase-4-is-already-stacked-with-incredible-actors\">Oscar-winning actresses</a> to be a part of their Phase 4 plans, as they not only got Natalie Portman and Angelina Jolie to sign on for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2476928/thor-love-and-thunder\"><em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em></a> and <em>The Eternals</em>, respectively, but they have also enlisted Rachel Weisz for a key part in <em>Black Widow</em>. This is another character who will apparently carry the titular moniker in the movie, but given what we know from the source material, she may take on a different name before the end of the film: Iron Maiden. In the comics she is one of Natasha Romanoff\u2019s key adversaries, and while she looks like an ally at certain points in the trailer, an antagonist turn isn't off the table just yet. We don\u2019t yet know who is going to be under the mask, but <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476954/taskmaster-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-black-widow-villain\">Taskmaster</a> \u2013 a fan-favorite villain from Marvel Comics \u2013 has been confirmed to be <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476897/black-widow-concept-art-delivers-our-first-look-at-taskmaster\">making his live-action debut</a> in <em>Black Widow</em>. At this point it can\u2019t be said if the character\u2019s backstory will be altered for the cinematic treatment, but in the source material he has some fascinating abilities. Namely, he has what are called photographic reflexes, which is similar to a photographic memory in that he can instantly recall and imitate any movement of an opponent. He\u2019s so good, in fact, that he can study a foe\u2019s entire style in a moment (either in person or on video) and then process that information to predict and prepare for any attempted strike. He\u2019s one of the greatest fighters in the Marvel Universe, and Black Widow will be seriously challenged when going toe-to-toe with him. One of the biggest surprises in the <em>Black Widow</em> trailer was confirmation that an important antagonist in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will have a role to play in the movie: William Hurt's General Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross. As seen in the still above, it would appear that the character is going to have a role in the film's flashback sequences (given the use of deaging technology), and reveal that his personal history with Natasha Romanoff goes back further than we know. On top of that, it's very likely that Ross will be continuing to pursue Black Widow during the course of her solo film, given the aforementioned setting post-<em>Captain America: Civil War</em> and the fact that her last action in that blockbuster was to go against the orders of the Sokovia Accords by letting Captain America and The Winter Soldier escape during the Leipzig-Halle Airport Battle. Be sure to keep checking this space, as we will be continuing to update this feature as we get closer and closer to <em>Black Widow</em>\u2019s release in 2020.

    "title": "Jumanji 3: What We Know So Far About The Next Level",
    "content": "The game isn't over! The third movie in the <em>Jumanji</em> series, following 1995's <em>Jumanji</em> and 2017's <em>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</em>, is called <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475799/looks-like-jumanji-3s-title-was-leaked?pv=search\"><em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em></a>. Fans can expect a steady stream of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2442319/jumanji-3-will-not-be-released-the-same-weekend-as-star-wars-episode-ix\"><em>Jumanji 3</em></a> news, with updates continuing until the adventure movie arrives in theaters in December 2019. Here's what we know about the sequel so far, starting with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475850/the-jumanji-the-next-level-trailer-turns-the-rock-into-danny-devito\">the first trailer</a>, which was posted on July 1: That trailer fills in a lot of gaps on what the movie will be about, which is certainly helpful since there was no previous word on that front. <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> is currently scheduled for release on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2442319/jumanji-3-will-not-be-released-the-same-weekend-as-star-wars-episode-ix\">December 13, 2019</a>. That gives it exactly one week before <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/Star-Wars-Episode-IX-68597.html\"><em>Star Wars: Episode IX</em></a> takes over the box office. <em>Jumanji</em> has <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2408071/sony-boss-says-jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-sequel-will-compete-against-star-wars-again\">faced <em>Star Wars</em></a> in a showdown before, when <em>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</em> opened on December 20, 2017, just after <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>. Considering that both films picked up piles of money in 2017, there will still probably be room for both of them at the 2019 box office. Star/producer Dwayne Johnson announced the current <em>Jumanji 3</em> release date on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BkiXT47lEiP/\">Instagram</a> back in June 2018: Dates can change without notice, but this one should stick. The MPAA has yet to announce an official rating, but it will probably be PG-13. The first <em>Jumanji</em> in 1995 was PG, but this is more of a direct sequel to <em>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</em>, which earned a PG-13 rating in 2017 for \"adventure action, suggestive content and some language.\" It's still early days for <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> news, but considering <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2306481/jumanji-box-office-holy-crap-welcome-to-the-jungle-is-number-one-again\">how well <em>Jumanji 2</em> did</a>, there's a very high chance they won't change much about the basics for the 2019 movie. <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em> had a reported budget of around $100 million and the film made nearly $1 billion at the worldwide box office, per <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jumanji2016.htm\">Box Office Mojo</a> figures. It was the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2017 and the 42nd-highest-grossing film of all time. Of that total, $404.5 million came from the domestic box office, and $557.5 million from the foreign box office. No one really saw this coming, since the 1995 Robin Williams movie just made $262.8 million (not adjusted for inflation). If it ain't broke... As suggested in the previous entry, the second <em>Jumanji</em> film was such a hit that Sony is bringing back the major players for <em>Jumanji 3</em>. According to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/02/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-sequel-scott-rosenberg-jeff-pinkner-sony-dwayne-johnson-kevin-hart-jack-black-1202278493/\">Deadline</a>, Sony asked Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner back to write a sequel, with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2459136/jumanjis-dwayne-johnson-and-jake-kasdan-are-doing-another-movie-together\">Jake Kasdan</a> returning to direct and help shape the story. Matt Tolbach will be producing, along with the Seven Bucks Production team of Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, and Hiram Garcia. Production Weekly (via <a href=\"https://movieweb.com/jumanji-3-production-start-date-locations/\">MovieWeb</a>) said <em>Jumanji 3</em> was scheduled to start production January 21, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471636/jumanji-3-is-finally-finished-filming-and-the-rock-shared-a-fitting-tribute\">it wrapped in May 2019</a>. <em>Jumanji 2</em> filmed in Hawaii and Georgia, but <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> not only <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2469908/jumanji-3-wraps-filming-in-atlanta-the-rock-previews-new-desert-and-mountain-locations-ahead\">filmed in the usual jungles</a> of Hawaii, the cast went to snow-capped mountains and also the desert, for new levels of the game. The trailer for <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> showed Spencer ended up back in the game, with the rest of the original high school crew heading back in to get him. Spencer's grandfather (Danny DeVito) and grandfather's friend Milo Walker (Danny Glover) both got stuck in the game with them -- playing The Rock and Kevin Hart's avatars, respectively -- adding a new level of hilarity. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2437230/jumanji-3-is-underway-and-the-rock-is-still-ripping-on-kevin-hart\">Back in June</a>, Dwayne Johnson shared a photo from a development meeting, teasing just this on the plot: He just loves to mess with Kevin Hart! The four high school teens of <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em> left the film as newfound friends, and they destroyed the game in the end. But, since we're dealing with fantasy and magic, no one should've expected the game to truly be destroyed. <em>Jumanji 2</em> had some alternate endings that were discarded, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jumanji-welcome-jungle-alternate-endings-revealed-1069469\">THR</a> reports, and it's possible the filmmakers will dip back into that well at some point. Some of the actors shared ideas for the sequel. Jack Black said he <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2415222/jack-black-has-a-crazy-idea-for-jumanji-3\">wanted to head into space</a> for an origin story. He wants to know where the game comes from, and who invented it, figuring it must be alien technology or from some \"crazy jungle medicine man magic.\" Karen Gillan added that she'd like to see <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2384152/jumanji-3-karen-gillan-tells-us-the-type-of-character-shed-like-to-play\">a really old man</a> choose her avatar, Ruby Roundhouse, so she could go from playing an introverted teen in <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em> to channeling the mannerisms of an old man. Here's what we know: Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas will return. In <em>Jumanji 2</em>, they played the respective avatars Smolder Bravestone, Sheldon Oberon, Franklin Finbar, Ruby Roundhouse, and Jefferson \"Seaplane\" McDonough. Back in August, <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-sequel-details/\">/FILM</a> talked to director Jake Kasdan and asked if the same kids would play a new game of Jumanji (despite thinking they destroyed it). Kasdan said they were busy figuring all of that out. He did say he believed it would be a continuation of Jumanji as a video game, rather than the board game of the first film. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Rock-Movies-List-Upcoming-Films-Starring-Dwayne-Johnson-133037.html\">The Rock</a>'s game avatar, Smolder Bravestone, plays to his literal strengths. He's a confident and clearly very muscular archaeologist and international explorer. In <em>Jumanji 2</em>, Dwayne Johnson got to play <em>against</em> type when the person playing his avatar was nerdy, allergy-prone Brantford High School student Spencer. Playing strong Dr. Bravestone helped Spencer develop his own confidence and leadership skills. The first trailer for <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> showed Spencer's grandpa Eddie (Danny DeVito) ended up taking on the Bravestone avatar. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/Jack%20Black/\">Jack Black</a> had a fun role in <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em> as Professor Sheldon Oberon. His cartographer was played by popular, self-absorbed pretty girl Bethany, who was not expecting to be Black's \"overweight middle aged man\" when she picked the avatar descriptor \"curvy genius\" when deciding to play the game. But, her character evolved over the course of the adventure. Hopefully Jack Black gets to continue to stretch his comedic chops in <em>Jumanji 3</em>. This time, as the <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> trailer showed, \"Fridge\" ends up in the \"old, fat dude\" avatar. Brantford High School football jock \"Fridge\" picked weapons and zoology expert Franklin \"Moose\" Finbar because he sounded \"like a badass.\" To his surprise, he ended up in the much shorter body of Kevin Hart. Hence, size jokes. The set-up of Fridge and Spencer being former friends who reconcile through the game of Jumanji worked perfectly for the dynamic of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2460781/do-dwayne-johnson-and-kevin-hart-have-another-movie-on-the-way\">Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/1524519/central-intelligence\"><em>Central Intelligence</em></a> co-stars have great comedic chemistry, so <em>Jumanji 3</em> is going to have to harness that magic again. Based on the <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> trailer, that chemistry is put to great use. This time, Spencer's grandfather's friend Milo (Danny Glover) ends up in Franklin's body. Karen Gillan plays \"killer of men\" Ruby Roundhouse, a fierce martial arts and dance fighting expert. Her avatar was played by shy high school student Martha. But <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/avengers-endgame-66373.html\"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a> star Gillan has <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2384152/jumanji-3-karen-gillan-tells-us-the-type-of-character-shed-like-to-play\">gone on the record</a> to say she'd love to see an old man play the Ruby avatar in a future movie. Interestingly enough, so far it looks like that's what happened for The Rock and Kevin Hart's avatars but not Karen Gillan's. Nick Jonas was something of a surprise addition to the group as avatar pilot Jefferson \"Seaplane\" McDonough. He was the avatar of gamer Alex Vreeke, a teen who got stuck in the Jumanji game in 1996. This storyline was a direct tie to the original 1995 <em>Jumanji</em> film, since Alex had taken shelter in the game world in a house built by the previous Jumanji player, Alan Parrish, portrayed on film by Robin Williams. In <em>Jumanji 2</em>, the four main players are rescued by Alex, who was the fifth player that was missing and unplayable when the teens first picked up the game. <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em> ended with Alex being able to go back to his own time, and grow up to be Colin Hanks, who named his child after Bethany after she saved his life. We'll have to see how the pilot character of Seaplane is used in the third film. A few months ago, we got <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464553/jumanji-3-has-cast-its-first-new-actors\">word on the first new stars</a> joining the <em>Jumanji 3</em> team. <em>Ocean's 8</em> and <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> star <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2455787/will-crazy-rich-asians-sequel-china-rich-girlfriend-happen-heres-what-awkwafina-says\">Awkwafina</a> was said to play a \"key\" and \"significant\" character in this movie. Shortly after that news came out, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465237/jumanji-3-an-updated-cast-list\"><em>Jumanji 3</em> cast list</a> updates revealed that household name <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/danny%20devito/\">Danny DeVito</a> would also be joining <em>Jumanji 3</em>. About a week later, it was revealed that Danny Glover would also be joining the cast. Now we know DeVito plays Spencer's grandfather Eddie with Glover as Eddie's friend Milo. DeVito ends up in The Rock's avatar, with Glover in Hart's, and hilarity ensues. Dwayne Johnson, of course, posted about the new additions but didn't reveal anything about their characters beyond <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BssI2sAhjD6/\">this little tease</a> with his Danny Glover post: \"The magic of our JUMANJI Universe is 'who turns into who?' and I'm excited for our [global] audience to join Danny and our entire cast on another wild and fun adventure.\" It's kind of fun seeing what surprises may be ahead, but there's more attention being paid to this movie, since <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em> was such a success, so they may not be able to hide all the tricks up their sleeves. It was initially thought that <em>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</em> would be a reboot of the <em>Jumanji</em> franchise. Instead, it was a sequel to the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1721090/how-robin-williams-blew-off-steam-while-shooting-jumanji\">1995 Robin Williams movie</a>. It didn't have <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2382971/the-original-jumanji-easter-egg-you-may-have-missed-in-welcome-to-the-jungle\">many references</a> to the original, but it was clear that it was set in the same universe. Director Jake Kasdan <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2455332/will-jumanji-3-call-back-to-the-original-movie-heres-what-the-director-says\">said he plans</a> to have <em>Jumanji 3</em> connect to both previous films, but especially <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em>: Jake Kasdan also seems fond of the timeline element -- that players return to where they started in the real world once they win, even if years have passed in the game; while the in-world game retains elements from previous players, like the nod to Alan Parrish. This is most likely up to the box office. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who expected <em>Jumanji</em> to get a sequel, never mind <em>Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle</em> getting a sequel, too. Some people consider this to be <em>Jumanji 2</em>, since it's more of a direct sequel to <em>Welcome to the Jungle</em> with only passing references to the first film. But, some people also think 2005's <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Zathura-1208.html\"><em>Zathura: A Space Adventure</em></a> is part of the <em>Jumanji</em> franchise, even though that movie's plot has no references to any <em>Jumanji</em> films. It was marketed as being set in the <em>Jumanji</em> world, as it's based on Chris Van Allsburg's sequel to the <em>Jumanji</em> novel. Either way, it's too soon too to say if Dwayne Johnson, Jake Kasdan and company will return for a <em>Jumanji 4</em>. If <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> cleans up at the box office this December, and into early 2020, that'll be a good sign. But, they'd also have to come up with a worthy idea, instead of just continuing because it might make more money. If <em>Jumanji 3</em> disappoints on the story front, it would put a damper on any hopes for a fourth film. So, we shall see. This <em>Jumanji: The Next Level</em> guide will be updated periodically as more news, trailers, photos, and updates from The Rock come out before the December 2019 release.

    "title": "Disney Pixar's 'Soul': What We Know So Far",
    "content": "Pixar, and its ever loyal animation partner Disney, have been kicking lately with the critically acclaimed <em>Toy Story 4</em> and the announcement of its upcoming suburban fantasy <em>Onward</em> inciting mass anticipation. Most recently, they gave fans a taste of what else there is to come with the official announcement of <em>Soul</em>. So far, there is very little known about <em>Soul</em> other than the very delicately designed title, and the film has been a mystery since IMDb had it listed only as an \u201cUntitled Pixar Animation Project.\u201d The plot synopsis that Disney and Pixar released with the announcement of the title barely answers any questions, either. More accurately, it just <em>creates</em> more questions. As of right now, <em>Soul</em> is described by Disney and Pixar, via social media, as \u201ca journey from the streets of New York City to the cosmic realms, discovering the answers to life's most important questions.\u201d Even for a Pixar film, that is a highly ambitious, yet incredibly vague concept. Regardless, as the case usually is with any movie from Disney and Pixar, I am very much anticipating <em>Soul</em>, mostly because I am curious to discover more about it. On that note, what do we know about <em>Soul</em> so far? Read on to find out. Technically, <em>Soul</em> was first announced in early 2016 whilst <em>Inside Out</em> was up for Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards. There was no mention of a title, plot details, characters, or anything of the like. All that was known was that an idea had been pitched at Pixar. That was, until June 19, 2019, shortly before the release of <em>Toy Story 4</em>, when Pixar tweeted out this special message: As you can see, we got the title (in an eye-catching art style, to boot), but still no hints at any notable characters and a very, very vaguely stated plot description. Mysteriously dense concept aside, the reveal of <em>Soul</em> had fans excited to see Pixar putting out more original content in the next year, having released <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471787/toy-story-4-might-be-pixars-last-sequel-for-years\">two sequels in two years</a> with <em>Incredibles 2</em> in 2018 and <em>Toy Story 4</em> the following year. As you can see from the aforementioned tweet, <em>Soul</em> will be arriving in theaters on June 19, 2020. This will come exactly a year after the release date\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475264/after-onward-pixars-next-movie-will-go-in-search-of-the-soul\">official announcement</a> and a little more than three months after the Disney and Pixar release of <em>Onward</em>, featuring the voices of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2463414/pixar-grabs-chris-pratt-tom-holland-and-more-for-its-next-movie-onward?pv=search\">Tom Holland and Chris Pratt</a>. There is actually a fun fact associated with <em>Soul</em>\u2019s release date. It will be coming out exactly five years after the release of 2015\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Inside-Out-66607.html\"><em>Inside Out</em></a>, which also came out on June 19 that year. Believe it or not, this is not the first time a Pixar movie has encountered such a coincidence. In fact, <em>Soul</em> will be the fourth Pixar film to be released the same day as a previous Pixar film. The first instance of this curious phenomena occurred when <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Good-Dinosaur-68437.html\"><em>The Good Dinosaur</em></a> was released on November 25, exactly 17 after 1998\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2452040/when-a-bugs-land-is-closing-to-make-way-for-disneylands-new-marvel-area\"><em>A Bug\u2019s Life</em></a>. The other examples of this include <em>Coco</em> and the original <em>Toy Story</em>, both released on November 22 just 22 years apart, and, most recently, <em>Toy Story 4</em> was released on June 21, 2019, the same day as 2013\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Monsters-University-6464.html\"><em>Monsters University</em></a>. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Seriously-Awesome-Letter-From-Pete-Docter-Pixar-Fan-19026.html\">Pete Docter</a> has served co-director on three previous Disney/Pixar classics: <em>Monsters Inc.</em>, <em>Up</em>, and <em>Inside Out</em>. This time, <em>Soul</em> will be his first solo directorial effort on a full-length animated feature. Pete Docter, born in Minnesota in 1968, has been an animator since even before joining Pixar. He released his first short film <em>Winter</em> in 1988, which he followed with <em>Palm Springs</em> and <em>Next Door</em>, all of which were hand drawn. Pete Docter joined Pixar at 21 years old in 1990 (upon late Pixar veteran Joe Ranft\u2019s recommendation to John Lasseter) with limited abilities and having little to no experience with computer animation. However, Docter was quickly assigned larger and larger roles in the company and even became one of the key creators behind the development of <em>Toy Story</em>, basing the character of Buzz Lightyear mostly on himself. <em>Soul</em> comes from a story conceived by Pete Docter, but there is no confirmation of who is writing the script. However, when considering the premise as Disney and Pixar have presented it and that Docter was one of the minds behind <em>Inside Out</em>, I imagine we are in for a philosophical, emotionally resonant treat with this one. There is still much more to know about Disney and Pixar\u2019s <em>Soul</em> before it comes out June 19, 2020. Until then, be sure to check back with CinemaBlend for more updates.

    "title": "Avatar 2: What We Know So Far",
    "content": "Over the last 10 years we've seen countless major movie franchises come and go, but few have had the global appeal of James Cameron's <em>Avatar</em>. Released in December 2009, the film continues to hold the record as the highest-grossing movie of all time, pulling in $2.782 billion worldwide and while that record may be <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471505/james-cameron-congratulated-avengers-endgame-for-sinking-titanics-box-office-records?pv=search\">about to fall</a>, the strength of <em>Avatar</em> should not be overlooked. We have been patiently waiting for sequels to arrive ever since, and while the filmmaking team behind the franchise has been taking its time, they have some absolutely gigantic plans for the future. <em>Avatar 2</em> and its several other sequels have been in development for years and while it has looked a time or two like the movies might never actually happen, the second and third <em>Avatar</em> sequels are actually in production now, so baring massive disaster, they at least will happen. Here's everything we know about <em>Avatar 2</em> so far. <em>Avatar 2</em> was originally set for release back in 2015, but one delay after another set in, which pushed the date back again and again. The movie was always slated for a Christmas release, but <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/James-Cameron-Just-Delayed-Avatar-2-Here-Why-69157.html\">what year that would happen</a> was never very clear. Finally, release dates for not just <em>Avatar 2</em>, but all the sequels were set, with the first movie coming in 2020 and it seemed like that date might stick. However, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471402/avatar-and-new-mutants-just-pushed-back-their-release-date-again\">one additional delay</a> was announced when Disney set its first release calendar following the Fox merger. <em>Avatar 2</em> is now set to open <strong>December 17, 2021</strong>. Films with major blockbuster potential like <em>Avatar 2</em> usually want to get as many butts into those theater seats as possible. So, while there's been no word on the actual story of the sequel, it's unlikely that it will drift into <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2461540/apparently-avatar-was-originally-supposed-to-be-r-rated?pv=search\">Rated R territory</a>. We should also note that the original film received a PG-13 rating, and it's a good bet that <em>Avatar 2</em>, and the three sequels planned after it, will attempt to stick with the same rating. The first <em>Avatar</em> was truly a passion project for James Cameron, as the filmmaker spent years and years developing both the script and the technological advancements that needed to be made. So, you didn't really expect him to hand off the sequels to someone else, did you? Cameron will be coming back for not just <em>Avatar 2</em>, but for <em>3</em>, <em>4</em> and <em>5</em> as well. He has some big plans for the technological side of things, and has talked about both filming at <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Avatar-Sequels-Feature-Worlds-Habitats-Cultures-41723.html\">higher frame rates</a> using <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/James-Cameron-Bring-Performance-Capture-Underwater-Avatar-Sequels-36815.html\">performance capture underwater</a>. You can be sure that <em>Avatar 2</em> will push the boundaries of what can be accomplished in modern filmmaking. Cameron wants to show that the first film's success was not <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-James-Cameron-Nervous-About-Avatar-2-99737.html\">a fluke</a>. The director is certainly not expecting success to come automatically to the <em>Avatar</em> sequels simply because the first one did well. Officially, <em>Avatar 2</em> has no title beyond simply that, <em>Avatar 2</em>. A collection of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2460658/the-avatar-sequels-titles-may-have-been-revealed?pv=search\">potential subtitles</a> were leaked that appeared to give the next movie the title <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em>. James Cameron later confirmed that the leaked titles were <em>potential</em> names for the film, but he claimed nothing has been decided on yet. James Cameron was the lone credited screenwriter on the first <em>Avatar</em> movie, but for the four sequels he has brought in a full team of collaborators who have helped him break down all upcoming chapters of the franchise. Josh Friedman, who penned Steven Spielberg's <em>War of the Worlds</em> remake and was one of the key people behind the television series <em>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</em>, was the <a href=\"http://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/james-cameron-taps-terminator-series-creator-write-avatar-2-exclusive-106766\">first one</a> to sign on. Then, he was followed by <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</em> veterans Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, and <em>Armageddon</em>'s Shane Salerno, all of whom will be working side-by-side with Cameron. Major plot details haven't been revealed yet, but the director has said that the sequels will introduce \"<a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Avatar-Sequels-Feature-Worlds-Habitats-Cultures-41723.html\">whole new worlds, habitats, and cultures</a>,\" which very well could mean that we will get to meet some different kinds of intelligent alien species. While the <em>Avatar</em> sequels were written as one large, ever expanding beast, and are being largely filmed together, we're being told that each of the upcoming films, including <em>Avatar 2</em>, are being created as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466713/the-avatar-sequels-will-be-standalone-movies-according-to-the-producer?pv=search\">standalone films</a>, rather than being four parts of a larger story. With so many details about <em>Avatar 2</em> and the other sequels still scarce, we recently got an update on the content of those films from James Cameron. While speaking about <em>Toruk</em>, the Cirque du Soleil <em>Avatar</em> prequel, Cameron spilled the beans on a major theme for the planned films: family. The one thing we do know about <em>Avatar 2</em> is that the story will be focused around the oceans of the planet Pandora, and what details we have about new characters would appear to confirm that much. This will come as a surprise to absolutely nobody, but the main character of <em>Avatar</em> might be coming back for the franchise's sequels. Sam Worthington, who has spent the years since his breakout role in the original sci-fi blockbuster starring in movies like <em>Clash of the Titans</em>, <em>Man on a Ledge</em> and <em>Sabotage</em>, <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Avatar-Sequels-Officially-Add-Sam-Worthington-Zoe-Saldana-41117.html\">had signed a deal</a> that would have seen him playing human-turned-Na'vi Jake Sully for the foreseeable future. The Aussie actor was even the first to reveal the production start date in November 2013, saying, \"I'll be grateful if it finishes. I think Jim is building the ship to Pandora, to be honest.\" But, now that we know the <em>Avatar</em> sequels will each tell different stories that simply form a complete saga, it's unclear if there will even be a role for Worthington in any of the planned films. Of course, production didn't start anywhere near November 2013, and has, in fact, still not begun to any significant degree, so casting on any of the sequels could change at any time. If Jake Sully comes back, you know that his alien lady love would come back as well, and that had been the case. Like Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/sam-worthington-zoe-saldana-back-669894\">had confirmed</a> that she would be back as Neytiri in <em>Avatar 2</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>4</em> and <em>5</em>. The actress talked a bit about what she had seen from the production, and even admitted that she and James Cameron <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Zoe-Saldana-Opens-Up-About-Avatar-Sequels-41211.html\">got very emotional</a> discussing the story that was then supposed to play out over the next few years. But, with Saldana becoming a queen of the sci-fi genre in her own right since the release of <em>Avatar</em>, taking part in not just the new <em>Star Trek</em> films, but also Marvel Studios' <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/Guardians-Of-The-Galaxy-5920.html\"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a>, along with the fact that the <em>Avatar</em> sequels have yet to begun production in earnest, it's no longer a guarantee that she'll be involved in a major way. As with most of what's been happening with the <em>Avatar</em> franchise, we'll have to wait and see. Many of you will probably remember that Dr. Grace Augustine (played by Sigourney Weaver) actually died in her Avatar form in the last movie, but, apparently, the original plan for <em>Avatar 2</em> was not going to stop her from appearing in the sequel. Less than <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Sigourney-Weaver-Will-Return-For-Avatar-2-17290.html\">three months after</a> <em>Avatar</em>'s release in 2009, it was confirmed that Dr. Augustine has a place in <em>Avatar 2</em>. In October 2010, James Cameron explained the character's survival by saying \"<a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/James-Cameron-Offers-More-Avatar-2-Details-But-Still-Won-t-Commit-To-Starting-Work-On-It-21308.html\">Nobody dies in a science fiction movie</a>,\" but the real reason will presumably be revealed in the sequel, if Weaver's character will still be involved. What we do know is that whatever form Weaver takes in <em>Avatar 2</em> will be evolving over time. A few years ago she said that her part is a little bit different in each sequel and that she'll \"<a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Sigourney-Weaver-Transform-With-Each-Avatar-Sequel-42956.html\">transform somewhat</a>\" between them. However, it's possible her character has been transforming even within the script writing process. Even more recently, Weaver has said she's <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/How-It-Possible-Sigourney-Weaver-Avatar-Sequels-70098.html\">not actually playing the same character</a> in the sequels as she did in the original. So, maybe Grace Augustine is dead after all, even though Sigourney Weaver will be back. It's hard to say for sure at this point. Remember that quote about nobody really dying in a science-fiction movie? Well, that rule apparently applies to Stephen Lang's Colonel Miles Quaritch, who we last saw getting two arrows through the chest courtesy of Neytiri. While audiences may have assumed that the villain had passed on, it turns out that's not the case. Described as the \"Darth Vader\" of the franchise, our last information on Quaritch said that he was going to continue to be an antagonistic force in all upcoming <em>Avatar</em> sequels. James Cameron has said that he has a very <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2013/10/james-cameron-has-found-avatars-darth-vader-its-stephen-lang/\">interesting and unexpected arc</a> through the movies, so he's definitely a character to keep an eye on. In addition to these major returning characters, several other actors will be returning to the world of Pandora for <em>Avatar 2</em>, if not every sequel that comes after. Dileep Rao played Dr. Max Patel, one of the scientists on the Avatar program who comes to the aid of Jake Sully. Joel David Moore will be back in the role of Norm Spellman, another friend of Sully's, and the only human allowed to remain on Pandora after the rest of humanity is booted out at the end of the first film. CCH Pounder will be back as Mo'at, the spiritual leader of the Na'vi. Also, Matt Gerald will be back as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, which makes him no less than the third actor who will return for <em>Avatar 2</em> despite the fact that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1689580/another-dead-avatar-character-will-somehow-be-back-for-the-sequels\">the character died</a> in the first movie. The bulk of the new actors joining the cast of <em>Avatar 2</em> are actually quite young. We know that the story will focus largely on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1707700/avatar-2-adds-seven-new-characters-telling-us-a-lot-about-its-story\">the children</a> of Jake Sully and Neytiri, as many years will have passed between the events of the first two <em>Avatar</em> movies. Jamie Flatters will play the oldest child of the two characters, a boy named Neteyam. Britain Dalton will play middle child Lo'ak. Youngest child, and only daughter Tuktirey will be played by the young Trinity Bliss.. There is a single confirmed human character being played by a child actor, Jack Champion will appear in the role of Javier 'Spider' Socorro. He was born at Hell's Gate, the former human colony, but prefers spending his time exploring Pandora. <em>Avatar 2</em> will also introduce us to an entirely new civilization of Pandora, the ocean-based Metkayina. Three major young roles have been cast from this group. Filip Geljo will play Aonung, the son of the Metkayina clan leader. Bailey Bass will play the role of Tsireya, a character described as a graceful and strong free diver. Finally, Duane Evans Jr. will play a character named Roxto. There are plenty of new grown up characters joining the cast of <em>Avatar 2</em>. The biggest addition to the cast is James Cameron's leading lady from <em>Titanic</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1709930/kate-winslet-joins-avatar-2-heres-who-shes-playing\">Kate Winslet</a>. She'll play a character named Ronal, but beyond a name we don't know much about her. Based on the fact that Winslet was holding her breath for seven minutes at a time during production, it leads one to believe she'll be playing one of the reef people of Pandora. Other new actors joining the <em>Avatar</em> franchise include <em>Fear the Walking Dead</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1656710/the-avatar-sequel-has-signed-on-its-first-star\">Cliff Curtis</a> as Tonowari, the chief of the reef people. Oona Chaplain will play Varang, who sounds like another Na'vi, but we don't really no for sure. Most recently, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/officialavatar/status/1128691582633480194\">Jemaine Clement</a> has joined the cast as one of the few confirmed new human characters, a marine biologist named Dr. Ian Garvin James Cameron is known for his love of technology. He seems to always be looking for new ways to use the newest techniques to do something unique in his movies. His use of 3D in <em>Avatar</em> is one of the main reasons that the technology is still used today and his work on motion capture, especially with faces, was a big part of what Cameron used to sell <em>Avatar</em> to both the studio and the public. But that was 2009, what has James Cameron been up to lately? <em>Avatar</em> producer Jon Landau has spoken with a man named <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Weird-Futuristic-Technology-Avatar-Sequels-May-Use-67231.html\">Douglas Trumbull</a> about a new film process that combines 4K resolution, 3D and high frame rates (up to 120 per second) into one package. This sounds like a match made in heaven for James Cameron. He's a big proponent of both 3D and HFR so it would be far from surprising if this tech was adopted for this, or future <em>Avatar</em> sequels. Because 3D essentially requires two frames in order to create it, getting 3D and a high frame rate at the same time is difficult, add in four thousand lines of resolution and the math gets even more complicated. All these things together, however, could bring Pandora to life like never before. Speaking of 3D technology, it's possible that the most challenging aspect of these new films will be Cameron's desire to use a 3D process that, wait for it, <em>doesn't</em> require the audience to wear special glasses while watching the movies. That technology is currently available, but the difficulty lies in utilizing it on a large screen meant for more than one viewer, and with people sitting at a wide variety of angles and distances from that screen. In theory, scaling up a glasses-free 3D image should be possible, but it hasn't been done at this point, and the cost of the process isn't commercially viable yet. Of course, with all the delays that have already occurred with the <em>Avatar</em> sequels, it's not impossible that James Cameron's films could be delayed long enough for production and the tech to catch up to one another. Following <em>Avatar 2</em> there will be at least three more movies. <em>Avatar 3</em> is filming concurrently with <em>Avatar 2</em>, and is scheduled for a December 2023 release. Originally, the plan was to wait to film the other two movies until after <em>Avatar 3</em> had been released. However, all that was before Disney purchased 21st Century Fox. The latter two movies had not been <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464633/avatar-4-and-5-dont-actually-have-a-green-light-from-disney-yet?pv=search\">officially given the green light</a> by Disney at that point. but <em>Avatar 4</em> and <em>5</em> are now on the official Disney release calendar and set for December 2025 and 2027 respectively. Based on how long these movies take to make, it seems likely the latter two films will be going into production earlier than previously planned. Now, with so many delays behind this franchise already, you might be wondering if the current sequel schedule is now firmly set in stone. Well, not quite. James Cameron's high standards rule where this is concerned, and, to his mind, the important thing is doing the films right instead of simply doing them quickly. When asked a while back if the December 2018 release date for <em>Avatar 2</em> was still correct, Cameron said: So, it looks like, aside from some much appreciated perfectionism, Cameron is also concerned with the release pattern of all the sequels. He doesn't want <em>Avatar 2</em> to be released and then end up having an unexpected delay for <em>Avatar 3</em> or for one of the other films to stop the flow of <em>Avatar</em> goodness into theaters for the next few years. This likely means that all films will have to be pretty near to completion before we get to see <em>Avatar 2</em> in theaters.

    "title": "Aquaman 2: What We Know So Far",
    "content": "In 2018, James Wan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1468249/aquaman\"><em>Aquaman</em></a> became a remarkably surprising smash hit. Nobody really knew what to expect from it for multiple reasons, given that it was following the disappointing release of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1464489/justice-league\"><em>Justice League</em></a>; centered on a character who had never had his own live-action solo movie; and was facing stiff competition at the box office in the form of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1468369/Mary-Poppins-Returns\"><em>Mary Poppins Returns</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1468039/bumblebee\"><em>Bumblebee</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1466319/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-3d\"><em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em></a>. To everyone\u2019s shock, however, the film not only became a billion dollar hit, but now stands as the biggest worldwide earner in the history of DC Comics adaptations. Naturally, the excitement that the project generated immediately led Warner Bros. to solidify a future for the franchise, and within a few weeks of <em>Aquaman</em>\u2019s release we learned about their plans to develop an <em>Aquaman 2</em>. But what will the project be about? Who will be making it? When will we actually get to see it? These are all major questions that we\u2019re here to discuss. In this latest edition of our What We Know So Far guides, we\u2019re going to break down all of the information that\u2019s currently available about <em>Aquaman 2</em>, and provide you with all of the most recent news that we\u2019ve heard about the project. So, without further ado, let\u2019s dive in! It\u2019s typical for Hollywood studios to try and produce sequels as quickly as they possibly can. After all, they don\u2019t want to let the heat of a burgeoning franchise die down, and the more time that passes means there\u2019s more opportunities for audiences to be distracted by other big properties. That being said, <em>Aquaman 2</em> is taking an extra minute to find its way to theaters, as Warner Bros. has announced that the blockbuster follow-up is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467564/aquaman-2-is-officially-happening\">currently scheduled</a> to be released on <strong>December 22, 2022</strong>. So, why is <em>Aquaman 2</em> coming out about four years after its predecessor? For starters, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/podcast/2469874/heroblend-49-shazam-review-and-an-interview-with-producer-peter-safran\">producer Peter Safran</a> has noted that the filmmakers behind the movie don\u2019t feel the need to rush the project, believing that giving the sequel the most development time possible will ultimately be beneficial for the final product. But that\u2019s not the only reason. Not only is the film going to need some legitimate time to actually get made from a logistics standpoint (it\u2019s not super easy creating those underwater environments), but there are also many other <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/dceu\">DC Extended Universe</a> titles in the works that the studio is developing between now and December 2022. Arguably, the biggest of these is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1685059/wonder-woman-2-what-we-know-so-far\"><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em></a>, which will be coming out in summer 2020, but they are also in the midst of making Cathy Yan\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2458169/birds-of-prey-and-the-fantabulous-emancipation-of-one-harley-quinn\"><em>Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)</em></a>, Matt Reeves\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466110/we-finally-know-when-the-batman-is-coming-out\"><em>The Batman</em></a>, and James Gunn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466112/suicide-squad-2-get-a-new-title-and-a-release-date\"><em>Suicide Squad 2</em></a>. All of those blockbusters are set to come out between now and December 2022, and will deserve their own special attention from WB. The world of comic book movies has changed a great deal over the years. For the longest time, the concept of an R-rated superhero blockbuster seemed absolutely insane, as just by the nature of the rating a project would presumably be dismissing what was seen as a massively important demographic: teenagers. Then Tim Miller\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1464969/Deadpool\"><em>Deadpool</em></a> came along and completely shattered that notion forever by making nearly $800 million worldwide. After that, the entire concept became much more acceptable, and we have seen multiple examples since. That being said, audiences shouldn\u2019t expect <em>Aquaman 2</em> to receive any rating other than a PG-13 when it finally hits theaters. Admittedly, final decisions in this arena aren\u2019t typically made until the film is near completion and the MPAA gets a look at the product that\u2019s heading to theaters, but it\u2019s basically impossible to believe at this point that <em>Aquaman 2</em> will be made with anything other than a PG-13 rating in mind. After all, it\u2019s not really a character who is known for R-rated behavior in the comics, and the first movie functioned perfectly fine without any kind of extreme violence, overt sexuality, or adult language. So while there isn\u2019t really any kind of official word available in this arena, it\u2019s still pretty obvious what direction the project will go in. Since breaking out in 2004, director James Wan has become one of the industry\u2019s most significant franchise masterminds. After all, his career not only started with the launching of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Saw-718.html\"><em>Saw</em></a> movies, but since then he has also brought to life the terror featured in the worlds of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1455999/Insidious\"><em>Insidious</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1460529/Conjuring\"><em>The Conjuring</em></a> (not to mention the fact that he also directed <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1461639/Furious-7\"><em>Furious 7</em></a>). The filmmaker is no stranger to sequels at this point, and is definitely going to be involved with <em>Aquaman 2</em> as a producer at the very least, but what\u2019s not 100% clear yet is if he\u2019s also going to be working on the film as a director. While James Wan may be great at starting new series, he typically doesn\u2019t stick around for too long in the director\u2019s chair, as he\u2019s only actually helmed two direct sequels to his movies: <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1460779/Insidious-Chapter-2\"><em>Insidious: Chapter 2</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1463869/Conjuring-2\"><em>The Conjuring 2</em></a>. To his credit, he seems to prefer creating new worlds over repeatedly revisiting them. That being said, the idea of him directing <em>Aquaman 2</em> isn\u2019t off the table yet, and one can imagine that Warner Bros. is doing everything in their power to bring him back. We\u2019re still waiting for final decisions on the director front, but at the very least <em>Aquaman 2</em> does have a writer set who's working on the script. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, who was a co-writer on the first <em>Aquaman</em>, has been hired to pen the script for the sequel. The filmmaker has a bit of sequel experience on his resume already, having written <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Wrath-Titans-5795.html\"><em>Wrath Of The Titans</em></a>, <em>The Conjuring 2</em>, and the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2470429/the-conjuring-3\"><em>The Conjuring 3</em></a>, and it seems that Warner Bros. trusts him with the responsibility of structuring a proper follow-up to the biggest DC Comics adaptation ever. Jason Momoa has had many ups and downs over the course of his career \u2013 from playing Khal Drogo on <em>Game of Thrones</em> to his disastrous <em>Conan The Barbarian</em> remake \u2013 but now he\u2019s found some real stability courtesy of the DC Extended Universe. He first won a lot of people over with his charismatic turn as Arthur Curry a.k.a. Aquaman in <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JusticeLeagueOfficial/\"><em>Justice League</em></a>, but the solo movie was really his show, and now the actor is a bona fide blockbuster star. Aquaman, of course, went through some major changes in the 2018 movie, and it will be fascinating to see how he develops as a character through the events that play out in <em>Aquaman 2</em>. Initially the guy was seriously rough around the edges, being a part of two very different worlds, but belonging to neither of them, but he became a very different hero by the end of the debut solo movie. Not only did he finally begin understanding his place in the world, but he also found himself declared as the king of the seven underwater kingdoms \u2013 including Atlantis. But what kind of ruler will he actually be? Will he have what it takes to make the hard decisions that are required in the job? Will he be able to forge peace during threats of war? These are all big, lingering questions that will surely be addressed in the upcoming follow-up. One could make a very strong argument that Arthur Curry would never have been able to ascend to the throne of Atlantis without the assistance of Mera in <em>Aquaman</em>, as she was there to support him every step of the way. She was the one who first got him involved in the fight against Orm in order to save the world; she saved his life multiple times; and all throughout the story provided crucial information that allowed Arthur to find the Trident of Neptune and solidify his claim. She was absolutely vital to the events of the blockbuster, and one can imagine that won\u2019t change in the slightest when it comes to the sequel. While there hasn\u2019t been official word just yet, Amber Heard is expected to reprise her role as Mera in <em>Aquaman 2</em>, presumably working closely with the new king of Atlantis and making sure that he makes not only the right calls, but operates as a just and righteous leader. Exactly what her story will entail beyond the relationship is currently a mystery, but, hopefully, we\u2019ll get more information on that front as more details come out about the development of the project. One of the biggest question marks going into the making of the first <em>Aquaman</em> was in regard to how the film would treat one of the heroes\u2019 most iconic villains: Black Manta. After all, while comic book fans have loved the look of the undersea antagonist for decades, it was unknown if the character would actually properly translate to the big screen (particularly his large, wide helmet). As it turned out, however, Black Manta, as played by the awesome Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, was one of the best parts of James Wan\u2019s 2018 blockbuster. And, while his role was ultimately fairly limited in terms of screen time, that should change a lot in the upcoming <em>Aquaman 2</em>. Obviously the first movie was primarily dedicated to establishing the \u201corigin story\u201d of its titular superhero, but fans also got to see how Black Manta became Black Manta in the DC Extended Universe. Initially we meet him as a mercenary pirate pulling jobs with his father (Michael Beach), but he sees his life get turned upside down during a job gone wrong. Aquaman not only manages to stop a hijacking mission that he\u2019s on, but also watches his dad die as the Atlantian refuses to help him. He swears vengeance against Arthur Curry, and we expect to see a lot more of that vendetta in <em>Aquaman 2</em>, especially because he\u2019s getting help from a key ally\u2026 Only being <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2402372/aquaman-has-added-an-important-dc-character-during-reshoots\">added to the film during reshoots</a>, Randall Park\u2019s Dr. Stephen Shin didn\u2019t exactly have an extensive role in the first <em>Aquaman</em>, but he definitely made an impression \u2013 living up to the expectations of his comic book counterpart. Dr. Shin is a scientist who is obsessed with the existence of Atlantis, and while he has a tremendously hard time convincing anybody that he is right, he also never wavers in his commitment to his theory. Unfortunately, his passion may take him to some pretty dark places in <em>Aquaman 2</em>, as he will, apparently, be teaming up with Black Manta as part of the movie\u2019s plot. We know about this team-up courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2463760/aquaman-end-credits-scene-what-it-might-mean-for-aquaman-2\">end credits scene in <em>Aquaman</em></a>, which primarily centered on Dr. Shin and Black Manta. Beginning in the follow-up to the battle in Sicily, Italy, Shin rescues the laser-shooting antagonist as he is injured and floating in the ocean, and brings him back to his private lab. After healing Manta, Shin proffers a deal: if the former promises to help prove the existence of Atlantis, the latter will do what he can to support the mission of vengeance against Aquaman. Played by Willem Dafoe, Vulko was introduced to audiences as one of the most influential people in the life of Arthur Curry, as he was the one who taught the future Aquaman about Atlantis when he was a kid, and even went as far as to actually train him to use his abilities. They were estranged for many years afterward, but through all that time Vulko remained loyal to the heir to the throne, and even when it potentially would cost him everything, he did what he could to support Arthur through the events of <em>Aquaman</em>. It\u2019s not currently known if Willem Dafoe will return to reprise his role as Vulko in <em>Aquaman 2</em>, but it\u2019s probably a safe bet. After all, he not only survived the events of the 2018 blockbuster, but he will also likely be a key advisor to Arthur as he tries to figure out what kind of king he is going to be. Hopefully we\u2019ll get more specifics as we get closer to the film getting made. James Wan and Patrick Wilson clearly enjoy working together, as <em>Aquaman</em> was actually their fifth collaboration as director and actor \u2013 with the star playing the movie\u2019s principal antagonist, Orm. It was perhaps because of this relationship that the blockbuster made the decision to not kill off the former king of Atlantis, also known as Ocean Master, and instead have him imprisoned for his actions. Obviously this means that he\u2019s still alive in the DC Extended Universe, and could potentially be back for <em>Aquaman 2</em>, but exactly what his role would be is unclear at this point. Based on the information mentioned above, it definitely seems like Black Manta and Dr. Stephen Shin are being set up as the primary villains in the sequel, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Orm won\u2019t have some kind of role to play in the action. Patrick Wilson has <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468307/patrick-wilson-doesnt-think-hell-be-the-big-villain-of-aquaman-2\">gone on the record</a> saying that he doesn\u2019t expect that he will be the big bad of <em>Aquaman 2</em>, but also noted that he\u2019d be happy to reprise the role should James Wan make the request. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see as more information about the blockbuster comes to light.

    "title": "Fantastic Beasts 3: What We Know So Far",
    "content": "Merlin's beard, we have so many questions about the third <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> movie! For one, what will it be called? It has a title, and the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2461658/fantastic-beasts-3-has-a-title-but-only-some-actors-know-it\">castmembers appear to know it</a>, but it has yet to be announced. So much of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2461801/what-fantastic-beasts-3-needs-to-do\"><em>Fantastic Beasts</em></a> 3 is still as mysterious as Credence's backstory, but we do have enough information to get started. So, here's what we know at this point about the movie that will follow <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/1583830/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them\"><em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1541649/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald\"><em>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</em></a>, and precede the planned sequels <em>Fantastic Beasts 4</em> and <em>Fantastic Beasts 5</em>. Keep your eye on this guide, because we'll update it with new intel as the owls fly in. Warner Bros. finally issued <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470990/fantastic-beasts-3-has-an-official-release-date\">an official release date</a> in late April 2019: <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em> is currently scheduled to open November 12, 2021. <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em> was initially hoped / expected to release on November 20, 2020, then WB <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467053/when-denis-villeneuves-dune-reboot-will-be-released\">gave <em>Dune</em></a> that release date. Production on <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em> <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465439/why-fantastic-beasts-3-filming-was-delayed-by-several-months\">was initially delayed</a> from starting to film this July, 2019, to starting instead in late fall 2019. Filming was delayed yet again to start in the spring of 2020 to match the new November 2021 release date. Dan Fogler (Jacob Kowalski) <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466720/fantastic-beasts-3-was-delayed-for-a-gigantic-reason-per-dan-fogler\">said filming was delayed</a> because the third movie is \"bigger than the first two combined.\" The \"gigantic\" movie needed more time to prep, and they didn't want to rush anything. Also, screenwriter J.K. Rowling is said to be <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467635/jk-rowling-is-trying-to-make-fantastic-beasts-3-better-than-crimes-of-grindelwald\">re-working the script right now</a> (spring 2019), to try and make the third movie better than <em>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</em> after the relative disappointment of the second movie with fans, critics, and the box office. The MPAA won't reveal <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em>'s official rating until well after filming, closer to the release date. But it's almost certainly going to be PG-13. <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em> was rated PG-13 for \"some fantasy action violence.\" <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em> was rated PG-13 for \"some sequences of fantasy action.\" Expect something similar for <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em>. Ah, the biggest question! When a fan asked J.K. Rowling to describe the third film in three words, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2463281/jk-rowling-described-fantastic-beasts-3-in-just-three-words-and-theyre-perfect\">she replied,</a> \"Answers are given.\" What answers, though? Since this is the third of five planned movies, we know not everything will be wrapped up in <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em>. However, we know some things. The first film was set in 1926 in New York, with the second film set in 1927, mostly in Paris. Dan Fogler already revealed they'd be <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466720/fantastic-beasts-3-was-delayed-for-a-gigantic-reason-per-dan-fogler\">going to Brazil</a> for part of the third movie, but he also said it would be bigger than the previous two movies combined. In late 2018, J.K. Rowling <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/1057961162883719168\">made her Twitter</a> header a photo of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in the 1930s, in what was seen as a big clue on what's to come. She also hinted at seeing more of a professor from Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the North American school of magic, so we have to include that U.S. school as a potential location. If the movie is set in the 1930s, that would be a bit of a time jump, but it would still leave a long way before the planned ending for the franchise in 1945. That's the end of World War II but also the year of Gellert Grindelwald and Albus Dumbledore's big duel. Speaking of world wars, Grindelwald ended the second movie gathering followers to his cause, partly by using the fear of world war if they kept in the current muggle-led direction. Queenie and Credence joined Grindelwald's cause, for their own reasons. Meanwhile, one of Newt Scamander's Niffler friends stole the blood vial sealing the blood pact between Dumbledore and Grindelwald. The next film doesn't have a synopsis at this point, but it may follow the team fighting Grindelwald's followers around the world while they search for a way to break the blood pact. That way Dumbledore can fight Grindelwald (which apparently takes a while since they don't duel until 1945). Presumably, there will also be more fantastic beasts in the third movie. And, at some point, Nagini is set to become one of them. David Yates appears to be continuing with the franchise, potentially to the end. He started in J.K. Rowling's magical world with <em>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</em> and continued with <em>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</em>, and both <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</em> movies. He returned to direct the first two Potter prequel movies in the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> series, and it looks like he's at least signed up for the third movie. Two years ago, longtime producer David Heyman told <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2456318/will-david-yates-direct-all-five-fantastic-beasts-films\">CinemaBlend</a> he'd like to see David Yates continue to direct all five films. But it sounded like it was partly up to Yates himself, and also dependent on how things played out. So, there's still a glimmer of hope for my dream that Oscar winner <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464637/why-alfonso-cuarn-should-direct-the-final-fantastic-beasts-movies\">Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n will return to the <em>Harry Potter</em> universe</a> to direct one of the final <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> movies. It's just not gonna be this one. The <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> series centers around Newt Scamander, and that is likely to continue. Newt was trying to stay neutral but he ended the second movie by telling his brother Theseus that he had firmly chosen his side -- with him and Auror Tina, against Grindelwald. Newt seems to be Albus Dumbledore's #1 agent / puppet. In typical Dumbledore fashion, he only doles out little bits of information at a time. The movie ended with Newt presenting Dumbledore with the blood vial a Niffler stole from Grindelwald. So, now they can consider how to destroy it and let Dumbledore fight Grindelwald. Newt has a long history in the <em>Harry Potter</em> world <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467610/newt-scamanders-backstory-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-fantastic-beasts-hero\">that you can catch up on</a> before the third movie arrives. <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em> started with Johnny Depp's character escaping prison custody and ended with him holding a rally for his followers. He preached for an end to the statute of secrecy protecting muggles from the truth about wizards. He used images of World War II to justify his plans for domination, and had his followers go spread the world. His rally was also attended by Aurors, but he escaped them once again. First, he created a line with blue flame, with his supporters on one side and enemies on the other. Queenie and Credence joined Grindelwald and left with him to his castle in Nurmengard in Austria. That's where Grindelwald dropped the shocker on Credence that he was actually Albus Dumbledore's long-lost brother, Aurelius. Do we believe that? You have to consider the source. Grindelwald appears to want to use Credence to defeat Dumbledore, since he can't face his old more-than-friends buddy himself. Albus Dumbledore made his debut in the second movie and had a relatively small role. That role is expected to get bigger as we approach the big duel between Dumbledore and his former great love, Grindelwald. The second movie ended with Dumbledore saying \"maybe\" when Newt asked if the blood pact with Grindelwald could be broken. But, it must be broken at some point in the next couple of movies. In a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467049/fantastic-beasts-reveals-key-grindelwald-and-dumbledore-history-in-deleted-scene\">deleted scene</a> from <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em>, Newt openly asked Dumbledore why he sent him to New York for the events of the first movie. Dumbledore answered that he knew Grindelwald would try to catch Credence. Grindelwald had had a vision years ago that an Obscurial killed the man he fears above all others, presumably Dumbledore. So, Dumbledore wanted to \"deprive Grindelwald of his weapon,\" not by killing Credence, but by saving him. Unfortunately, that did not work. And now we have the news, according to Grindelwald, that Credence is actually the younger brother of Albus and Aberforth. Is it true? If so, does Dumbledore know? It would be classic Dumbledore to have information that he chose not to share with others, so we'll have to see. A fragment of Credence's Obscurus survived <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>, as a sign that his story was not done. In the second film, he teamed up with Nagini in a search for his own history. Who was he? Through Leta Lestrange, he learned that he was (probably? definitely?) the baby who was swapped at the last moment before a shipwreck took the life of her real half-brother. Later, Grindelwald told Credence he was actually Aurelius Dumbledore. Grindelwald could've been lying, or just wrong, but there was a phoenix that emerged, which is said to be a tie to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2461778/6-big-dumbledore-family-things-to-know-after-fantastic-beasts-2\">the Dumbledore family</a>. So did Percival Dumbledore have a child while in prison, the half-brother of Albus, Aberforth, and Ariana? Ariana was said to likely be an Obscurial like Credence. The second film ended with Credence casting a very powerful spell with his wand while at the Grindelwald HQ in Nurmengard. Maybe the \"answers\" J.K. Rowling promised will be connected to Credence. Many fans left <em>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald</em> frustrated with Queenie for deciding to side with Grindelwald. But sweet Queenie started the movie by enchanting Jacob to do what she wanted, to come with her to Europe so they could get married and avoid the muggle / wizard marriage ban in the U.S. So, she's already no stranger to controlling muggles, even if it's coming from good intentions. When Newt lifted the enchantment, Jacob was understandably upset. Queenie left to find her sister in Paris and, while there, she became distraught and was comforted by Grindelwald's followers. He made an argument that she'd be joining him for love, to change the laws that keep wizards separate from muggles. Actress Alison Sudol <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2461879/how-fantastic-beasts-2s-alison-sudol-feels-about-that-queenie-twist\">defended Queenie's choice</a> by saying her character wasn't turning evil, she was trying to find someone who would give her an option, a cause she could believe in to create a better world. She doesn't know what's actually going to happen, even if <em>Harry Potter</em> fans do. The end of the film showed her advising Grindelwald to be gentle with Credence, since she could read the young Obscurial's mind and knew he wasn't sure he had picked the right team. Jacob is the lone muggle amid wizards in this series, which puts him in a dangerous position. They tried to erase his memory after the first movie, but he retained a vague memory of his beloved Queenie. In the second movie, he was fully part of the team in Paris and then at Hogwarts in the end. Obviously, he has no magic powers to help in the fight, so it's not clear what his role will be from here -- other than trying to help Tina bring her sister Queenie back from the dark side. Actor Dan Fogler revealed that, in his last scene there at Hogwarts, you can see Jacob looking in another direction from the other characters. (See photo above.) <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2461764/dan-fogler-reveals-what-jacob-is-thinking-at-the-end-of-crimes-of-grindelwald\">Fogler said</a>, in that moment, Jacob was hoping that Queenie would have a change of heart and come back; if she did, he would be able to forgive her, but we'll have to wait to see what the next film holds for those two. Tina is now a MACUSA Auror, and she spent <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em> looking for Credence. She also got caught up in a silly love triangle when she believed an inaccurate news report saying Newt was engaged to Leta Lestrange, meaning that we had to deal with that awkwardness between Newt and Tina before it was cleared up. Tina is fully part of the team trying to stop Grindelwald, but her sister Queenie is now on Team Grindelwald, which makes things especially difficult. Never mind whether Tina and Newt or Queenie and Jacob will end up together, how are the sisters going to reunite when they are on opposite sides of this wizard war? <em>Harry Potter</em> fans are very familiar with the character of Nagini as villain Voldemort's sidekick Horcrux snake. It was a shock, then, to learn that Nagini was actually a woman -- a seemingly kind, gentle one -- when she was younger. Nagini is a Maledictus, a girl with a blood curse that will eventually turn her into a beast. This means that at some point we're probably going to see how Nagini turns, permanently, into a snake. Since the series reportedly ends in 1945, will we see how she connects with Voldemort or not quite? And how does she turn to the dark side? Nagini's whole role in <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em> was as Credence's supportive sidekick -- apparently that's her lot in life. They escaped the circus and then went searching for his history together. Credence went with Grindelwald because Grindelwald promised him answers on who he really is. Nagini was shown at Hogwarts with Newt, Tina, Jacob, Theseus, Dumbledore, and others fighting against Grindelwald. There's a lot of story that needs to be told to explain how Nagini goes from there to Voldemort's slave snake. Hopefully, they don't sideline Nagini in the next film, since she deserves to do more than just show up and comfort Credence. Apparently there's some confusion about whether Leta Lestrange died in the blue flames toward the end of <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em> or not. Zoe Kravitz was on co-star Dan Fogler's <em>4d Xperience</em> podcast (via <a href=\"https://www.hypable.com/leta-lestrange-dead-zoe-kravitz/\">Hypable</a>) and said it was \"kind of a last minute change that she got toasted.\" Fogler, who plays Jacob, said they have to bring her back somehow. She said it would be cool if they did, but she had no idea what they were going to do. Leta is / was engaged to Newt's brother Theseus, but she has a history with Newt, and seemed to be his first love. She shared her tragic backstory in the second <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> film, including her confession that she switched her brother Corvus Lestrange with another baby during a ship voyage; that other baby was supposedly Credence. Corvus died in the shipwreck, while the other baby survived, and Leta was tortured by guilt. Will she be back in the third film, or is her part in this story complete? Newt's older brother was introduced in the second movie. He's a British Auror, and engaged to Leta Lestrange. But if Leta did die, I guess that engagement is pretty much over. Theseus seemed frustrated with Newt for initially not wanting to take a side in the fight against Grindelwald, with Newt wanting to be neutral. The brothers embraced after the loss of Leta and the devastation in Paris, and Newt told his brother he had chosen his side. It's not clear what role Theseus might have in the third movie, but he's an Auror so he'll be wanting to continue the fight against Grindelwald and his followers. Pretty-much-immortal alchemist Nicolas Flamel had a small role in the Paris-set second movie. His name is familiar to Harry Potter fans from <em>The Sorcerer's Stone</em>. He spent time with Jacob in <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em>, and joined the fight against Grindelwald's curse on the city toward the end. Flamel didn't have too much of a role in the second movie, but he's a friend of Dumbledore's. And, because he's an alchemist, could he be the one who figures out how to break the blood pact between Dumbledore and Grindelwald? We'll have to wait and see. Lally Hicks, a professor at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the U.S., had a blink-and-you-missed-her role in <em>Crimes of Grindelwald</em>. Jessica Williams' character was shown briefly when Nicolas Flamel was flipping through a book after seeing a vision of death and destruction. She told him he had to go and try to help stop it. Before that movie opened, J.K. Rowling had teased <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/988189731556126720\">on Twitter</a> that \"You only see a HINT of Lally in Fantastic Beasts 2. Her true glory is revealed in FB3.\" We know Lally, an American professor, will have a pretty big role in <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em>. Doing what? And does that mean we go back to the U.S., to visit the Massachusetts-set Ilvermorny, or will she be joining the team in Brazil or Hogwarts, or wherever else we go? There are no hints on that right now, but it should be fun to find out. J.K. Rowling surprised fans when she revealed that she was actually planning to write five movies for the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> series. Producer David Heyman <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2462262/david-yates-explains-why-fantastic-beasts-became-a-five-movie-franchise\">later explained</a> that she began by expecting three films but then, as she dug deeper and started writing the first script, she realized there was a lot more story to tell and didn't think she could fit it all in three movies. The five-film <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> series is expected to span from 1926 to 1945, with the final movie including the big duel between Grindelwald and Dumbledore. The second movie was set in 1927 but, as shown above, Rowling hinted at the third movie being set at least in part in the 1930s. There has been no confirmation about the third movie's timeline. Will it lead up to the start of World War II, or would that real-world war be left to play out opposite the magical one in the fourth and fifth movies? Time will tell. (Get it? Time? #classic) The <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> franchise is currently taking a moment to step back and reassess plans for the third movie after the significant drop in box office (and fan / critic reactions) after the second movie. Since J.K. Rowling is said to be reworking her script a bit, it's not clear how much could change. As of now, <em>Fantastic Beasts 3</em> is set to start production in late fall 2019 for a release date most likely to be in 2021, but we're on standby for official updates.

    "title": "Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 7 Things To Remember Before Season 7",
    "content": "<strong>Warning: SPOILERS for Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. are ahead!</strong> The end is near for our favorite group of S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives. Yes, the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2494460/agents-of-shield-receives-final-season-premiere-date-and-coulson-is-back\">final season of <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em></a> is quickly approaching, with the comic book show set to close out a seven-year run. While it\u2019s bittersweet to see the series end, it looks like Coulson, Daisy, May and the gang are about to face their greatest challenge yet. Needless to say, <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> could indeed <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2481489/agents-of-shield-swung-for-the-fences-with-season-7\">go out with a bang</a>. A lot transpired during <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> Season 6, which means the status quo will be quite different when we revisit the characters in Season 7. Of course, with so much going on, there are several key things you may want to remember before you start the new episodes. Luckily, we\u2019re here to jog your memory before things kick off. So let\u2019s dive in and see how things are shaping up for Marvel\u2019s best agents. In the Season 6 finale, Agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons, along with Chronicom ally Enoch, set a plan in motion that could prevent the Chronicoms from taking over Earth. That plan involved upgrading the Zephyr One\u2019s Jump Drive with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2496541/agents-of-shield-explains-different-time-travel-rules-than-avengers-endgame-in-season-7-video\">time travel</a> technology, which allowed the plane to send the team to New York, circa 1931. While stranded in time, the team now hopes to learn about the S.H.I.E.L.D. secrets that the Chronicoms are aiming to use to conquer the planet. The team may now be in the 1930s, but that doesn\u2019t exactly mean they\u2019ll stay there. The Chronicom Hunters seem bent on travelling to different points in S.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s history to ultimately wipe out the organization. So it\u2019s very likely the heroes could visit to a number of other time periods before the season concludes. The gang has never stayed in a single place for too long, as they recently fled (and lost) their latest base, The Lighthouse, to the Hunters. Yet having to possibly leap through time is going to take away even more stability from them. Another part of Enoch\u2019s plan involved the return of a friend that has since passed on. Because the Chronicoms are using history to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D., Enoch reasoned that the team needs an expert on the organization\u2019s history who can guide them on their new mission. With this, he suggested creating an advanced <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2477536/what-agents-of-shields-finale-twists-mean-for-coulson-and-season-7\">life-model decoy of Phil Coulson</a> using Chronicom tech. Simmons was hesitant about the idea, as was director Alphonso \u201cMack\u201d Mackenzie. Yet both went along with the idea, and Daisy Johnson proceeded to activate the android, which pleasantly greeted them. The inclusion of an LMD Coulson is interesting for a few reasons. First off, it provides the show with a logical (and unique) of retaining Coulson, who died sometime after the events of Season 5. The character also brings the late agent\u2019s arc full circle, in a way. While he retains all of the memories of his counterpart and more, his appearance and demeanor are reminiscent of Coulson\u2019s from the first season. You can also bet it\u2019s going to be somewhat tough for the others -- particularly Daisy -- to work with him at times, due to the memories associated with their deceased boss. Melinda May has more than lived up to her nickname, \u201cThe Cavalry,\u201d and this was especially true in the Season 6 finale. May was stabbed by Coulson lookalike Sarge and sent to the other side, yet she survived and prevented three of Izel\u2019s kind from unleashing their people. Not only that, but she also managed to return from the portal and then struck down Izel with the dagger Sarge used to stab her. Though May was near death due to her injuries, Simmons arrived with a group of agents and later had her placed in a Chronicom Cryo-Freeze Chamber to heal. Images from Season 7 have already shown us that May will eventually be back in action, but given the extent of her injuries, she may not be at 100% right away. This means the team could have to do without her for a little while. Still, those who may be disappointed by this can take comfort in the fact that The Cavalry will definitely have a role to play. Yes, it would appear that, once again, Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons find themselves in two different places. Our favorite <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> couple went through a lot last season, to say the least. After Fitz\u2019s death in the Season 5 finale, Jemma spent the early part of the next season searching for the present-day version of her husband who was still frozen in space. Even after she reunited with the prematurely-thawed Fitz, the two were still tested when they were placed inside each other\u2019s minds and forced to relive memories. To top it all off, it was revealed in the finale that Enoch\u2019s plan requires them to be apart. At this point, it\u2019s almost a given that FitzSimmons won\u2019t be apart for long, which is partially why they had no problem accepting Enoch\u2019s proposal. Still, this situation is a bit different because, as of right now, neither us nor Jemma know exactly where Fitz is. The two can communicate, but can\u2019t know the other\u2019s location. It\u2019s incredibly likely that the duo will reunite before the series ends; it could just be a long road for them to actually get there. Malachi and his Chronicom Hunters were secondary antagonists in Season 6, but now they\u2019ll take center stage as the Big Bads. Following the destruction of his homeworld (Chronyca-2) at the hands of the Shrike, Malachi was one of the few Chronicoms left and believed that Earth should be established as the new Chronyca. He then set out to do so by killing his commander (Atarah), taking control of his remaining people and raiding Nick Fury\u2019s Toolbox for info on S.H.I.E.L.D.. Now, he and his followers are headed back in time to wipe out the organization, which he sees as their last obstacle. Malachi has proven to be one <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>\u2019s most dangerous villains, as he\u2019s more than capable when it comes to a fight. In addition, he also has a group of loyal and lethal fighters who would follow him to the ends of the Earth. Let\u2019s not forget that Malachi is also a cerebral figure. Not many people would\u2019ve thought to go for the Toolbox, and now, he holds the fate of S.H.I.E.L.D. in his hands. What those secrets are remains to be seen, but we can all assume that in the wrong hands, they could rock the foundation of the Marvel Universe\u2019s famous peacekeeping entity. HYDRA has been nothing but trouble for the team since the first season, and whenever they\u2019ve crossed paths, it hasn\u2019t been pretty. But now, according to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4du3_6QGm8\">a recent trailer</a>, the team will not only have to save their own organization, but their enemy\u2019s as well. Most are probably well aware that HYDRA has a long history, which <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> has played with extensively. As of right now, the way in which the agents will have to preserve HYDRA hasn\u2019t been revealed, but the answer may be right in front of us. S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA are essentially two sides of the same coin, and they\u2019re forever linked by one fact \u2013 former HYDRA loyalists helped found S.H.I.E.L.D., which we learned in <em>Captain America: The Winter Solider</em>. So could Coulson and the gang be looking to protect some HYDRA members who will eventually contribute to S.H.I.E.L.D.? Or could there be a deeper connection that we\u2019re not even aware of? Only time will tell (no pun intended) how these entities connect to each other. Of course, with this being the final season, how can things end without a few familiar faces showing up. So far, we know several actors will be returning, such as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2496108/agents-of-shield-is-bringing-back-fan-favorite-as-new-character-for-final-season\">Patton Oswalt</a>, who\u2019s portrayed the identical Koenig siblings. Here, he could very well be playing one of their ancestors. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2478400/agents-of-shield-is-bringing-a-surprise-character-back-in-season-7\">Patrick Wartbutron will also reappear</a> as \u201870s agent Rick Stoner, who previously appeared in pre-recorded messages at the Lighthouse. The most surprising of the bunch, however, would have to be the return of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2494495/why-agent-carter-actor-was-surprised-to-be-brought-back-for-shields-final-season\"><em>Agent Carter</em>\u2019s Daniel Sousa</a>, played by Enver Gjokaj. Aside from those characters who\u2019ve been confirmed, it\u2019s easy to assume that there are more surprises in store. J. August Richard\u2019s Mike Peterson/Deathlok, a veteran character, seems like a perfect candidate. HYDRA\u2019s presence could even indicate the return of faces like Arnim Zola, who Toby Jones briefly reprised on <em>Agent Carter</em>. And if we\u2019re dancing on the line of both hero and villain, who wouldn\u2019t want to see one final appearance from Brett Dalton\u2019s traitorous Grant Ward? With 13 episodes in this final season, there\u2019s more than enough time for old friends and enemies to come through for a final hurrah. So what are you most looking forward to seeing on the final season of <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>? What questions do you still have about the team\u2019s final mission? Let us know in the comments section below, and be sure to check out the season premiere when it airs on Wednesday, May 27 at 10 p.m. ET on ABC.

    "title": "The Top 10 Movies Of 2019 So Far, According To CinemaBlend",
    "content": "We are now fully through seven months of 2019, and thus far we have been on quite a cinematic adventure this year. Hollywood has served up an interesting, diverse slate of movies from all kinds of genres for us to consume since early January, and while quite a significant number of the titles really haven\u2019t been all that great, the same can\u2019t be said for all of them. There have been more than a few films that we\u2019ve actually really loved, and it\u2019s those films we are here to celebrate today. Every year CinemaBlend maintains a screening log that tracks the various movies that members of our staff are seeing, along with their \u201cout of five\u201d rating \u2013 and this ranking is based on those statistics. In order to qualify, any movie not only had to have a high enough score, but also had to have been seen by at least four people on the team. So without further ado, let\u2019s jump into the Top 10 films of 2019 so far\u2026 <strong>Average Score:</strong> 3.875<strong>/5</strong> Interestingly, Riley Stearns\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2476130/the-art-of-self-defense-review\"><em>The Art Of Self-Defense</em></a> isn\u2019t a movie that is really for everybody, as it\u2019s a dark comedy that goes pitch black at times\u2026 but I suppose that just says something about the CinemaBlend staff and our tastes. The movie is deeply funny, perfectly stylized, and even has a good amount to say about toxic masculinity and how it affects both the individual and society. You can describe it as Wes Anderson\u2019s <em>Fight Club</em> or the end result of what would happen if Jody Hill and Yorgos Lanthimos had a baby, but no matter what references you use, what\u2019s most important to recognize is that it\u2019s one of the year\u2019s best comedies. <strong>Average Score:</strong> 3.875<strong>/5</strong> Alexandre Aja's <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2476356/crawl-review\"><em>Crawl</em></a> is a movie that really came out of nowhere, primarily due to very limited press screenings, but it turns out to be one seriously late summer surprise. Its premise is as high-concept as they come \u2013 with a father and daughter trapped in a house during a hurricane and find themselves surrounded by alligators \u2013 and it\u2019s a film that does a really fantastic job executing that simple premise. It has some legitimately shocking and scary moments, with just the right amount of carnage, but most importantly you really do find yourself caring about the characters. It\u2019s a great little creature feature to be released in the midst of the on-going horror boom, and will surely wind up finding a cult audience as buzz about it is further shared among friends. <strong>Average Score:</strong> 3.884615385<strong>/5</strong> It took nearly a full decade for Dean DeBlois\u2019 <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> saga to play out on the big screen, but now that it has, it can definitely be called one of the best animated trilogies ever. These movies have been gorgeously animated, deeply emotional, and shockingly dramatic from the very beginning, and the series-closer <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2466591/how-to-train-your-dragon-the-hidden-world-review\"><em>How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World</em></a> is an excellent way to close it out. We live in a pop culture age when bringing things to an end can be a devastating challenge because of all the pressure that is mounted, but this one is wonderfully satisfying. It\u2019s sad that we won\u2019t be getting more adventures of Hiccup and Toothless, but audiences of all ages will continue watching this series over and over for years. <strong>Average Score:</strong> 3.95<strong>/5</strong> Big, bold musicals are very trendy nowadays, and it certainly helps to have films like Dexter Fletcher\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2474146/rocketman-review\"><em>Rocketman</em></a> keep the love going. The new movie basically had the CinemaBlend staff members dancing in the aisle of their local to the sweet music of Elton John while enjoying seeing his life brought to life on the big screen. There is a lot to like about this trip, from its unconventional biopic approach, to it\u2019s awesome performance visuals, to the excellent turn by star Taron Egerton. Our staff really enjoyed this one a lot \u2013 to the point where it may reappear on CB\u2019s full Top 10 list at the end of the year. <strong>Average Score:</strong> 4<strong>/5</strong> Lulu Wang\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2476253/the-farewell-review\"><em>The Farewell</em></a> started 2019 strong with an acclaimed premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, but appreciation for the movie has only soared further since its release earlier this year. The based-on-a-true-story movie is not only a fascinating examination of contrasting cultures as Awkwafina's Billi travels back to China with her parents to say goodbye to her dying grandmother (who doesn\u2019t actually know she\u2019s dying), but also just presents a lovely narrative about family and what keeps us connected. It\u2019s both philosophically fascinating, and a melancholy kind of beautiful. It\u2019s cinematography is fantastic and script well written, and we can\u2019t wait to see Awkwafina take on even more challenging and dramatic material. <strong>Average Score:</strong> 4<strong>/5</strong> As demonstrated by the fact that <em>Hereditary</em> was ranked as our team\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464104/the-top-10-movies-of-2018-according-to-cinemablend\">sixth favorite movie of 2018</a>, Ari Aster is a filmmaker that continues to fascinate us here at CinemaBlend, and we were absolutely delighted by his sophomore effort released this summer. A break-up movie disguised as a horror movie, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2475437/midsommar-review\"><em>Midsommar</em></a> features an epic combination of stunning cinematography and throat-ripping terror for audiences to feast on, all brightly lit by a sun that basically never sets. It\u2019s a strange experience, really, as there are some images that will haunt your nightmares for days, but it also has a tremendous sense of humor an multiple laugh out loud moments. It\u2019s another excellent win for Aster, and we once again find ourselves deeply curious about what he will deliver for us next. <strong>Average Score:</strong> 4.15625<strong>/5</strong> Given the incredibly emotional ending of <em>Toy Story 3</em>, even some of the most hardcore Pixar stans found themselves a bit anxious about the development of a third sequel in the series, but Josh Cooley\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2474959/toy-story-4-review\"><em>Toy Story 4</em></a> adeptly calmed all concerns when it hit theaters this summer. The movie has a legitimate story to tell, specifically with Woody (Tom Hanks) going on a journey learning about independence, and there are some fantastic laughs along the way \u2013 many courtesy of new characters voiced by Tony Hale, Keegan-Michael Key, and Jordan Peele. You also have to give it love for finding a great way to bring back Annie Potts\u2019 Bo Peep following her absence from the last chapter. <strong>Average Score:</strong> 4.181818182<strong>/5</strong> When a coming of age comedy really works, it\u2019s hard not to really fall in love with it. After all, their bread and butter is recreating events and experiences to which all audiences can relate, and that creates a special emotional bond between individual and movie. Olivia Wilde\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2471689/booksmart-review\"><em>Booksmart</em></a> is a perfect example. The story may be super modern, but the plight of Amy (Kaitlyn Dever) and Molly (Beanie Feldstein) as they experiment with one night of moderately breaking bad before high school graduation is not only incredibly relatable, but also hilarious. It\u2019s an absolutely wonderful and silly film outfitted with a phenomenal cast of young stars, and it\u2019s the best straight comedy that we\u2019ve seen so far in 2019. Hell, it's easily one of the best overall. <strong>Average Score:</strong> 4.294117647<strong>/5</strong> Quentin Tarantino is truly one of the great auteurs of modern cinema, and in 2019 he has delivered yet again with the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2476956/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review\"><em>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</em></a>. Despite the subplot about the Manson Family, the movie is oddly unique from the rest of the writer/director\u2019s body of work in that violence is not central to the main narrative \u2013 but he still very much has something to say about friendships, growing old, and finding your place in the world. As Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth, Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt bring to life two of Tarantino\u2019s best characters (which is really saying quite a lot), and the third act is one of his most jaw-dropping (which, again, is saying quite a lot). It may be a bit divisive, but among the 17 CinemaBlend staff members who saw it, none of us gave it a score lower than 3.5 out of five. <strong>Average Score:</strong> 4.456521739<strong>/5</strong> We here at CinemaBlend are big Marvel fans, with the majority of us spending the last decade repeatedly excited for the release of the latest blockbuster from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. As a result, we caught a serious fever of anticipation prior to the release of Joe and Anthony Russo\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2470714/avengers-endgame-review\"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a>, but the happy ending is that the film totally delivered on all promises. It\u2019s both a crazy fun adventure and also a perfect culmination of the 21 prior in-canon releases, and we really just went ape for it, as indicated by our team ranking. As of right now, it is our favorite film of 2019 \u2013 and it\u2019s very possible that it will maintain that position as we get to the end of December.

    "title": "Upcoming Star Wars Movies: List Of Titles And Release Dates",
    "content": "Following the release of the prequel trilogy, the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise stayed mostly dormant on the big screen for years... but now we may never see a dormant period for the franchise ever again. The brand was revitalized when the Walt Disney Company purchased Lucasfilm back in 2012, and nothing has been the same since the release of J.J. Abrams' <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/Star-Wars-The-Force-Awakens-6331.html\"><em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em></a> in December 2015. That billion dollar blockbuster kicked off a string of stories created by the studio, one coming out every year since, and it appears that the future will see many opportunities for <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/Star-Wars-Rogue-One-66522.html\">inventive storytellers</a> to play in this particular sandbox. And while the latest trio of saga features may soon be coming to an end, there is still a lot of new stuff being developed - including new trilogies and so-called Star Wars Stories. But what exactly are these projects that are currently in the works? How long do we have to wait for them? We've built this guide to specifically answer all of those questions and more, so read on and discover everything that we know so far about the <em>Star Wars</em> films that are in the pipeline. The hotly-anticipated <em>Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker</em> has undergone some significant behind the scenes shakeups. Initially the script for the film was written by <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em> writer/director Rian Johnson, and Colin Trevorrow was attached to direct... but that was before the death of Carrie Fisher. That tragic event unfortunately forced the filmmakers to scrap what they had been working on, and it was decided that Trevorrow would step away from the helm. Lucasfilm then hired <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> director J.J. Abrams to replace him, and he then co-wrote a new script from the end of the sequel trilogy with Chris Terrio. As is the case with all developing <em>Star Wars</em> projects, details about the plot and events we can expect to unfold are being kept under extreme wraps - though we certainly can infer a few things from where <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em> ended. In their battle against the First Order, The Resistance nearly faced defeat in the last adventure, but thanks to an inspirational appearance from the legendary Luke Skywalker everything changed. Rey is now very much on her way towards full Jedi status, and Kylo Ren is the new leader of the fascist galactic system following the death of Supreme Leader Snoke. It's also been confirmed that the thought-dead Emperor Palpatine will have a certain amount of influence on the way things go down, but that's basically only because of the laugh that can be heard at the end of the film's debut trailer. New generation stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Kelly Marie-Tran, Domhnall Gleeson and Lupita Nyong'o are all reprising their respective roles, and we'll also be seeing the return of Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, and Carrie Fisher (whose performance will be created with the use of archive footage and visual effects). New additions to the franchise include characters played by Keri Russell, Richard E. Grant, Naomi Ackie. Get the latest on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/1467669/Star-Wars-Episode-IX\"><em>Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker</em> HERE</a>. <strong>Release Date:</strong> December 20, 2019 As J.J. Abrams prepares to conclude the sequel trilogy and the legendary <em>Star Wars</em> saga, two new trilogies will be starting up to further expand the beloved sci-fi universe. The first of these will be the brainchild of <em>Game of Thrones</em> producer/writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss - who are working on the new set of blockbusters now that their hugely popular HBO series has come to an end. Nothing has been revealed in regards to what kind of story we can expect to be told in this set of features, or even what period of the vast timeline will be explored, but at the very least we do know when we will be seeing the first installment. It has been confirmed by <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471733/disney-just-confirmed-what-star-wars-movie-is-next-after-the-rise-of-skywalker\">Disney and Lucasfilm</a> that the debut chapter of the Benioff-Weiss Star Wars Trilogy will be the first to hit theaters following the release of <em>Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker</em>. That being said, we're still going to have to wait a minute for it, as the production of features in this franchise will be slowing down in the coming years. Not only will we no longer be seeing annual <em>Star Wars</em> movies, but the first of this particular branch won't be released until December 2022. From that point forward films from the universe will only be released biennially - and it hasn't been made clear if the franchise will be going back and forth between the two developing trilogies, or if one will get to play out entirely before the start of the next. Speaking of which... <strong>First Film Release Date:</strong> December 16, 2022 As mentioned above, <em>Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker</em> won't be using the script that was originally written by Rian Johnson, but franchise is far from done with him. Prior to the release of <em>Star Wars: The Last Jedi</em>, Lucasfilm announced that their collaboration with Johnson will continue with the development of an entire new trilogy of movies. Like the case with the Benioff-Weiss Star Wars Trilogy, it is entirely unclear at this time what this set of blockbusters will be about, when it will be set in regards to the <em>Star Wars</em> stories that we know, if/how it will connect to the classic films, or if it will include characters with whom we are already familiar. What we do know is that we will surely be hearing a lot more about these movies in the years to come. When it comes to the release date, that is another major mystery. As noted below, Disney/Lucasfilm have carved out three release dates for future <em>Star Wars</em> movies between now and the end of 2026. And as mentioned above, what's unclear is if the plan is to have fans experience a new movie from each trilogy every other year, or if Rian Johnson's next contributions won't start until after the Benioff-Weiss films are done. It may be a minute before we have final confirmation about this, but you can be sure we'll have all of the latest details for you as they arrive here on CinemaBlend. <strong>First Film Release Date:</strong> Unknown December 16, 2022<br/> December 20, 2024<br/> December 18, 2026 NJ native who calls LA home; lives in a Dreamatorium.

For instance, if an <em>SNL</em> fan reached adolescence in the \u201890s, they probably have cherished memories of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/adam%20sandler\">Adam Sandler</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/david%20spade\">David Spade</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/mike%20myers\">Mike Myers</a>, to name a few, inventing some of the long-running sketch comedy series\u2019 most iconic characters and moments. Indeed, even after it had aired long enough to dangerously brush against saturation, the \u201890s proved to be kind to <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, and remains <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Revealed-Lost-Early-90s-SNL-Movie-Might-Have-Actually-Been-Good-19649.html\">one of its more fondly remembered decades</a> for sketches you immediately know by name. From \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPpcfH_HHH8\">Schweddy Balls</a>\u201d to Saturday TV Funhouse\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWLSjrYmZAk\">The Ambiguously Gay Duo</a>,\u201d it was truly a great time to be an <em>SNL</em> fan. Unfortunately, some of our favorite \u201890s era cast members are no longer with us, such as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/pop/1746529/the-sweet-way-david-spade-honored-chris-farley-on-the-20th-anniversary-of-his-death\">Chris Farley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/SNL-Veteran-Jan-Hooks-Dead-57-67773.html\">Jan Hooks</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Phil-Hartman-Biopic-Putting-Together-Fantastic-Team-98497.html\">Phil Hartman</a>, but those who have survived are still leading career to make their fans, peers, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1419609/Lorne-Michaels-Know-It-Time-Quit-SNL\">Lorne Michaels</a> proud. This is what the following eleven \u201890s <em>SNL</em> veterans have been up to since their last Saturday night in Studio 8H. Adam Sandler\u2019s winning streak as a writer, actor, and producer since leaving <em>SNL</em> in 1995 is undeniable, despite some bumps (i.e. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/607929/Apparently-Pixels-Can-t-Make-Money-Other-Countries\"><em>Pixels</em>, for one</a>). Sandman went from <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Watch-Adam-Sandler-Hilarious-Version-Chanukah-Song-101817.html\">singing about holidays</a> on \u201cWeekend Update\u201d to rapping about his pockets' contents on his <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2458056/adam-sandlers-netflix-comedy-special-has-a-release-date-and-first-look-video\">Netflix special <em>100% Fresh</em></a>, while creating <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485899/the-5-best-adam-sandler-movies-and-the-4-worst\">iconic cinematic characters</a> (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, etc.) in between. Recently, Sandler received Oscar buzz (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2488353/adam-sandler-had-an-amazing-response-to-not-getting-an-oscar-nomination\">to no avail, unfortunately</a>) for 2019 thriller <em>Uncut Gems</em> and has a couple of spooky features coming, including <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476952/adam-sandlers-next-netflix-film-is-a-holiday-movie-but-not-what-you-think\">creepy Netflix comedy</a> <em>Hubie Halloween</em> and a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467536/hotel-transylvania-4-is-happening?pv=search\">fourth installment of the animated <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> franchise</a>, for which he is expected to reprise Count Dracula. Following her sketch comedy debut on <em>In Living Color</em>, Molly Shannon became an <em>SNL</em> \u201c<em>superstar</em>\u201d from 1995 to 2001, especially as quirky Catholic school student Mary Katherine Gallagher, who earned her own 1999 movie. The comedian has since stolen scenes on many films and TV series (some that star fellow <em>SNL</em> vets), including <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1334359/Wet-Hot-American-Summer-Series-Bringing-Back-All-Characters\"><em>Wet Hot American Summer</em></a> and the <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> franchise, but has also taken a few dramatic turns, such as <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Me-Earl-Dying-Girl-Trailer-Shows-Why-It-Could-One-2015-Best-70764.html\">playing a terminally ill teenager\u2019s mother</a> in <em>Me and Earl and the Dying Girl</em> and a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2488844/netflixs-fascinating-horse-girl-trailer-has-alison-brie-going-insane\">co-worker of a mentally disturbed Alison Brie</a> in 2019\u2019s <em>Horse Girl</em>. Shannon will <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2490900/a-snl-reunion-is-happening-on-vanessa-bayers-new-show\">next be seen with <em>SNL</em> alum Vanessa Bayer</a> for her upcoming TV pilot <em>Big Deal</em>. In addition to playing a Total Bastard Airlines steward or Dick Clark\u2019s insufferable receptionist, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Worst-Saturday-Night-Live-Host-Ever-According-David-Spade-95517.html\">David Spade\u2019s 1990-1996 <em>SNL</em> stint</a> is probably remembered best for infamous ribbing (to put it lightly) <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/david-spade-recalls-intense-eddie-murphy-feud-in-memoir-excerpt-193175/\">at former cast member Eddie Murphy</a>. Otherwise, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496264/tommy-boy-cool-behind-the-scenes-facts-about-the-chris-farley-movie\">co-starring with Chris Farley</a> in <em>Tommy Boy</em>, voicing <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/10-Underrated-Disney-Animated-Movies-117757.html\">Kuzco in <em>The Emperor\u2019s New Groove</em></a>, and even playing the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Joe-Dirt-2-trailer-Sends-David-Spade-Rude-Redneck-Back-Time-71799.html\">title character of <em>Joe Dirt</em></a> are just some roles that have kept him a relevant voice in comedy. In addition to leading <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496587/david-spade-thanks-fans-after-new-netflix-film-the-wrong-missy-hits-1\">top-rated Netflix rom-com <em>The Wrong Missy</em></a> in 2020, taking shots at pop culture is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484520/david-spade-hilariously-talks-licking-his-lips-during-noah-centineos-peoples-choice-win\">still Spade\u2019s bread and butter</a>, which he still does as host of Comedy Central\u2019s nightly discussion program <em>Lights Out</em>. Ana Gasteyer's Martha Stewart impersonation may be the best in the show's history, which is why she has reprised it on <em>SNL</em> outside her 1996-2002 run and, among other sketches, is key to her <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1707950/a-christmas-story-live-an-updated-cast-list\">welcomed presence in the various, eclectic roles</a> she has landed in TV and movies since, from playing a judge on <em>The Good Wife</em> to an alien abductee on TBS' <em>People of Earth</em>. The year 2019 saw <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2486527/the-masked-singers-christmas-tree-delivered-a-glowing-performance-but-was-it-enough\">Gasteyer disguised as a tree</a> on <em>The Masked Singer</em>, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470190/netflixs-wine-country-trailer-reunites-snls-funniest-ladies-for-day-drinking\">reunite with many other <em>SNL</em> alumni</a> in Netflix's <em>Wine Country</em>, and release <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/12/25/789864037/ana-gasteyers-sugar-booze-is-holiday-music-with-a-modern-wink\">a Christmas music album</a> called <em>Sugar &amp; Booze</em>. Her forthcoming projects include satirical rom-com <em>Happiest Season</em> and animated series <em>Magical Girlfriend Friendship Squad</em>. Despite lasting just three years, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2489367/why-snls-leslie-jones-almost-turned-down-the-show-after-chris-rock-got-her-an-audition\">Chris Rock's satirical brilliance on <em>SNL</em></a> defined him as one of the most (literally) recognizable voices in comedy today, as further evident by his <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Nick-Nite-Picks-up-Reruns-Everybody-Hates-Chris-9233.html\">hit semi-autobiographical sitcom</a> <em>Everybody Hates Chris</em>, voicing Marty the Zebra in the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Madagascar-973.html\"><em>Madagascar</em></a> series, his <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/chris-rock-returns-directing-showbiz-comedy-finally-famous-36113.html?ZRS\">three feature-length directorial efforts</a> thus far, and much more. However, it seems the stand-up icon is turning over a new leaf lately, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2455077/chris-rock-is-starring-in-his-first-tv-show-and-his-choice-might-surprise-you\">playing a 1950s mafia leader</a> in <em>Fargo</em>'s fourth season, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489676/please-let-chris-rocks-spiral-be-the-start-of-a-saw-anthology-series\">producing and starring in upcoming <em>Saw</em> reboot</a> <em>Spiral</em>, and <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2018/07/snl-michael-che-damon-wayans-jr-executive-producers-i-am-maurice-1202435281/\">appearing in announced sports biopic</a> <em>I Am Maurice</em>. Yet, one who is far from abandoning comedy is Rock, who will be seen in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475306/someone-was-stabbed-on-the-set-of-anne-hathaways-the-witches\">Robert Zemeckis' <em>The Witches</em> remake</a> and was tapped to <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/chris-rock-kenan-thompson-comedy-pilot-nbc-1203141458/\">direct the pilot of Kenan Thompson's upcoming sitcom</a> <em>The Kenan Show</em>. If you didn't realize Julia Sweeney played Pat on <em>SNL</em>, the 1990-1994 cast member would probably be happy to know that as the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1587300/the-crazy-saturday-night-live-secret-norm-macdonald-learned-from-chris-farley\">ambiguity of her most famous character's gender</a> was the joke. You might more easily recognize the actress and author as a <a href=\"https://stuartlittle.fandom.com/wiki/Mrs._Keeper\">teacher from Stuart Little's orphanage</a>, her 2019 <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/brooklyn-nine-nine-recap-season-6-episode-12-casecation-820021/\">appearance on <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em></a>, or from Sweeney's award-winning 1998 documentary <em>God Said, \"Ha!\"</em>, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/brooklyn-nine-nine-recap-season-6-episode-12-casecation-820021/\">chronicling her and her brother's struggles with cancer</a>, which her <em>Pulp Fiction</em> director Quentin Tarantino helped produce. Currently, Sweeney can be seen on fellow <em>SNL</em> lady <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2467059/is-aidy-bryant-really-considering-leaving-snl-heres-what-she-says\">Aidy Bryant's Hulu comedy <em>Shrill</em></a> and comedian Abby McEnany's Showtime series <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2020/01/work-in-progress-abby-mcenany-interview-showtime-lesbian-lgbt-1202206057/\"><em>Work in Progress</em></a>, which Sweeney also produces. Another great post-<em>SNL</em> success story is that of Mike Myers, who popularized \"<em>schwing</em>\" with \"Wayne's World\" and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1617450/why-mike-myers-hated-filming-the-bohemian-rhapsody-scene-in-waynes-world\">its two cinematic spin-offs</a> years before popularizing \"swing\" with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Austin-Powers-International-Man-Mystery-312.html\">his <em>Austin Powers</em> trilogy</a>, but the success of either is nothing compared to the four <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2460869/shrek-is-getting-its-own-reboot\"><em>Shrek</em> movies</a> in which he voiced the titular ogre. The Vancouver native's film and TV appearances grew increasingly mysterious, from his unrecognizable cameo in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Inglourious-Basterds-4078.html\">Quentin Tarantino's <em>Inglourious Basterds</em></a> to hosting the 2017 <em>Gong Show</em> revival <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2437760/mike-myers-finally-explained-his-gong-show-character-tommy-maitland\">under heavy makeup as Tommy Maitland</a>. However, he looks to be returning to more familiar territory by playing multiple characters in a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2470453/mike-myers-just-got-a-netflix-show-that-sounds-like-his-kind-of-bag-baby\">recently announced Netflix series</a> and there has been talk about <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2477395/austin-powers-director-isnt-sure-a-fourth-movie-could-happen-without-late-verne-troyer\">bringing back Dr. Evil</a> for a spin-off movie. We cannot mention \"Wayne's World\" without Garth, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1701199/why-waynes-worlds-bohemian-rhapsody-scene-was-torture-for-dana-carvey-to-shoot\">played by Dana Carvey</a>, who has made a recent return <em>SNL</em> for no other reason than to bask in his <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Dana-Carvey-Coming-Back-TV-Get-Details-97237.html\">flawless skills of impersonation</a> and bring back his most famous characters, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1581919/snl-watch-dana-carveys-church-lady-return\"><em>especially</em> The Church Lady</a>. Carvey's 1986-1993 run might be the peak of his career, however, considering his following efforts include variety program <em>The Dana Carvey Show</em>, whose abrupt failure was the <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/too-funny-to-fail-hulu-dana-carvey-show-documentary-review-1201889457/\">subject of a 2017 documentary</a>, or the 2002 Razzie-nominee <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-master-of-disguise-2002\"><em>The Master of Disguise</em></a>. Still, nowadays, every brief moment the comedian is back into the mainstream, such as for his <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1614140/how-many-people-now-subscribe-to-netflix-according-to-netflix\">2016 Netflix stand-up special</a> or voicing a dog in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/Secret-Life-Pets-66543.html\"><em>The Secret Life of Pets</em></a> movies, it is always met with celebration. If you don't remember Cheri Oteri by name, you might as one-half of an enthusiastic cheerleading duo with Will Ferrell or for her <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2487598/cheri-oteri-busted-out-her-barbara-walters-impression-for-new-years-eve\">spot-on Barbara Walters impression</a> during her 1995-2000 <em>SNL</em>. Additionally, you might recognize her as Gail Hailstorm in <em>Scary Movie</em>, the voice of Sleeping Beauty in <em>Shrek the Third</em>, or from her <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1549509/saturday-night-lives-cheri-oteri-is-returning-to-tv-in-a-big-way\">2016 <em>Scream Queens</em> appearance</a>. Among her forthcoming roles from in front of the camera or within the recording studio, Oteri is part of a voice cast <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2458122/shadowhunters-katherine-mcnamara-is-heading-to-arrow-season-7\">including Katherine McNamara</a> and Steve Gutenberg for <em>The Adventures of Bunny Bravo</em> and will share the screen with Jeremy Piven and Taryn Manning in the <a href=\"https://www.phillymag.com/news/2019/10/02/upper-darby-movie-crabs-in-a-bucket/\">indie comedy <em>Crabs in a Bucket</em></a>. An incomparably dry, shamelessly blunt delivery made Norm MacDonald <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1559889/norm-macdonalds-issue-with-saturday-night-live-right-now\">one of the most brilliantly savage \"Weekend Update\" anchors</a> in <em>SNL</em>'s history. The celebrated comedian got his own self-titled sitcom a year after his firing from the sketch comedy, but it would be the first of several short-lived attempts at his own series, including <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2011/06/comedy-central-cancels-sports-show-with-norm-macdonald-and-onion-sportsdome-141670/\">2011's non-scripted <em>Sports Show</em> on Comedy Central</a>, which would later pave the way for his popular interview podcast <em>Norm MacDonald Live</em> which was picked up after four years <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2385232/norm-macdonald-has-a-new-netflix-show-with-an-a-title\">as Netflix series <em>Norm MacDonald Has a Show</em> in 2018</a>, but only lasted one season. His most recent successes have been in voice work, such as a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1659710/seth-macfarlanes-the-orville-could-be-tvs-next-great-sci-fi-comedy\">recurring role as a gelatinous alien</a> on <em>The Orville</em> and a <a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2014/07/norm-macdonald-plays-an-alcoholic-pigeon-in-adult-swims-upcoming-mike-tyson-mysteries.html\">starring role as a talking pigeon</a> on Adult Swim's <em>Mike Tyson Mysteries</em>. Norm MacDonald has the struggle to lead a successful TV show in common with <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2411121/rob-schneiders-blunt-thoughts-on-current-day-saturday-night-live\">fellow '90s-era <em>SNL</em> veteran Rob Schneider</a>, who showed much promise with his impressive variety of characters, most famously the nickname-spewing office employee Richard Laymer. The <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/singer-elle-king-rob-schneiders-daughter-dropped-dads/story?id=34911637\">father of rock star Elle King</a> also proved to be an effective comic relief in 1993's <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474903/the-10-best-sandra-bullock-movies-ranked\">futuristic Sylvester Stallone thriller <em>Demolition Man</em></a>, but as a leading man, his most notable roles include a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/dvds/Deuce-Bigalow-Male-Gigolo-1081.html\">desperate male prostitute</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Animal-147.html\">half-man, half-animal</a>, a thief who <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Hot-Chick-404.html\">switches bodies with Rachel McAdams</a>, and himself in two <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Rob-Schneider-Wrote-Directed-Starred-Paid-Sitcom-70753.html\">self-titled, short-lived sitcoms</a>. However, it is always a treat to see him show-up for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475146/netflixs-murder-mystery-star-adam-sandler-reveals-the-co-star-hed-pin-a-murder-on\">his obligatory cameo</a> in just about all of his buddy Adam Sandler's movies.

There\u2019s been plenty of discussion of who\u2019s coming back, with both Neve Campbell and David Arquette\u2019s names <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496446/scream-5-is-officially-bringing-back-one-of-the-original-cast-members\">coming up in these early days</a>, but an even bigger question looms over this particular.

Looking at last year\u2019s severely underrated horror-comedy romp, it\u2019s not hard to see why these two helmers are perfect for <em>Scream 5\u2019s</em> collective director\u2019s chair. And with the recent HBO premiere of <em>Ready or Not</em> acting as another reminder of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2478375/ready-or-not-review\">how fun that particular film was</a>, it\u2019s a good reminder of just why the directing team known as Radio Silence are ready to continue Sidney Prescott\u2019s adventures in evading death. If you\u2019re going to make a movie like <em>Scream 5</em>, you really need to have a command of both the horror and comedy genre. Any director looking to command this particular franchise needs to understand both worlds as singular concepts, before they try to combine the two together. Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett showed their mastery in <em>Ready or Not</em>, as neither flavor is overridden by its complimentary number. Horror and comedy both get a chance to shine, as Grace (Samara Weaving) and her quest to survive a night of horror at the Le Domas family manor is at times horrifying and in other moments absolutely hysterical. <em>Scream 5</em> needs to keep that precarious cocktail of shock and laughs balanced, and merely on the merits of how <em>Ready or Not</em> turned out, Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett have that general understanding nailed down. On a more specific level, the pacing and pitch of <em>Ready or Not</em> does demonstrate the fact that Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett know their horror from their comedy. But even with that understanding at hand, there\u2019s a chance that the equation could be imbalanced in favor of one half or the other. Even working with a script from writers Guy Busick and R. Christopher Murphy, where the tension and horror are already baked in, <em>Ready or Not</em> still needs to have a director team that knows what works on the page. So it\u2019s pleasing to know that the balance of tension and humor in the film resonates perfectly in its final product. This is especially important for those working on <em>Scream 5</em> to keep in mind, and in the case of hiring Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett on their own, it works. However, as <em>Ready or Not</em> co-writer Busick is one of two writers working on this sequel\u2019s script, this team-up feels even more prone for success. While Neve Campbell is in talks to come back to <em>Scream 5</em>, there\u2019s a chance that another secondary protagonist is going to be cast to represent the next generation of potential victims. Whether she\u2019s even being considered for the role of not, Samara Weaving\u2019s performance in <em>Ready or Not</em> has proven that this film\u2019s team totally understands what makes a <em>Scream</em> protagonist work. Embodied with a survival drive so strong a particularly horrific hand injury is seen as an advantage, Grace\u2019s transformation from blushing bride to destroyer of the Le Domas family line is absolutely believable. Tack that onto a wit so sharp it could have probably killed in the absence of the various weapons in play, and you\u2019ve got a protagonist that would feel so at home in the world of <em>Scream</em>. As if <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496059/neve-campbell-explains-how-scream-5-could-happen-without-wes-craven\">their heartfelt letter to Neve Campbell</a> upon their hiring didn\u2019t show that Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett totally respect approaching <em>Scream 5</em>, they also know how to shoot and adapt a script that understand the franchise they\u2019re looking to become a part of. Most importantly, they know what a <em>Scream</em> protagonist needs to do in order to come off as believable. Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett\u2019s understanding of what makes a <em>Scream</em> protagonist extends to the entirety of the cast they put together for <em>Ready or Not</em>. Just taking one look at the actors that make up the film\u2019s Le Domas family shows they\u2019re ready to tackle that challenge too. Any potential <em>Scream 5</em> helmers need to uphold the tradition of a killer ensemble flanking the final girl who will defeat the latest variant of Ghostface. So casting an ensemble is something any potential director should be able to do in their sleep. Having heavy hitters like Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, and Andie MacDowell all challenging Samara Weaving\u2019s chances of survival in <em>Ready of Not</em> proves that Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett definitely have that skill. And what\u2019s more, they could even dip into that particular roster for <em>Scream 5</em>, should they really want to bring back one or many of the actors that made this hide and seek horror-comedy a fatal hit. There\u2019s a definitive look to the <em>Scream</em> franchise that needs to be carried over, or at the very least hinted towards, in <em>Scream 5\u2019s</em> telling. While filmmaking has evolved throughout the entire series\u2019 run, this horror classic has always looked like something you\u2019ve popped into a VCR, complete with the warm and cool tones only film can provide. Watching <em>Ready or Not</em>, you can tell that Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett love utilizing a very sharp and slick visual palette themselves. And as luck would have it, the demise of the various members of the Le Domas gaming dynasty looks like it too could have sat on a shelf of VHS tapes, while also maintaining a crisp and modern sheen. When you\u2019ve got a pair of directors that care about their chosen genre, right down to the visual presentation of a film like <em>Ready or Not</em>, you can bet they\u2019ll maintain that level of attention in <em>Scream 5</em>. And that\u2019s probably the cherry on top of this delightful murder sundae. Well, that and even <em>Scream\u2019s</em> OG writer Kevin Williamson is excited to work with this team as an executive producer on the next film. Which is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496498/why-the-original-scream-writer-is-thrilled-about-scream-5\">thanks to his own appreciation</a> of one particular film: <em>Ready or Not</em>. Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett have proven their hiring for <em>Scream 5</em> couldn\u2019t have been better timed. The funny thing is, they presumably didn\u2019t even know they were building such a case back when they made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtYTwUxhAoI\"><em>Ready or Not</em></a>. They really just wanted to make a slick as hell horror-comedy that entertains as well as it dazzles, and now the world can take the time to truly appreciate it as an appetizer for their efforts on this next <em>Scream</em> installment. Whether <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496556/ready-or-not-ending-explained-what-happened-and-what-happens-next\">you already know the ending</a>, or you\u2019re ready to take the plunge for the first time, <em>Ready or Not</em> is now available for rental/purchase, as well as currently airing on HBO\u2019s various platforms.

    "title": "8 Best Disney Channel Original Movies To Watch On Disney+",
    "content": "When Disney+ launched in November 2019, it began providing users with a supply of original streaming content. However, lost in the crowd of Disney\u2019s more <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1591070/upcoming-disney-animated-movies-full-list\">popular animated fare</a>, Marvel films, and <em>Star Wars</em> content were the beloved <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2491649/why-selena-gomez-calls-her-disney-fied-first-kiss-with-dylan-sprouse-one-of-the-worst-days-of-her-life\">Disney Channel</a> original movies. The classic TV movies filled many a childhood with thoughtful lessons, exciting worlds, music, and hilarity. For a long while, I had to rely on reruns or old recordings of my favorite Disney Channel original movies, but now that they\u2019re all available on Disney+, it\u2019s time to <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2474944/10-disney-channel-original-movies-that-will-remind-you-of-your-childhood\">dust off the collection</a>. In no particular order, here are the eight best Disney Channel original movies to watch on Disney+. (Most of them are from before 2005, so feel free to start singing the Disney Channel original movie theme song.) The Disney Channel didn't replay this movie as often as some of its other originals, but it's undoubtedly one of the best. Frances is a no-nonsense teenager who doesn't believe in the boogeyman. That is, until she's haunted by one and has to come to terms with how she's partly responsible. <em>Don't Look Under the Bed</em> challenged the ideas of growing up too fast and the consequences of untethering from the comfort of childhood. In short, Frances had to embrace that which scared her the most and own up to her own mistakes instead of running from them. It's a classic lesson wrapped up in imaginary friends and scary stories about the boogeyman, all told to great effect. Andrea loves racing, but she's never been able to compete alongside her twin brother Andrew simply because she's a woman. Classic sexism. So, when Andrew breaks his leg racing, Andrea, who goes by Andi for short, takes his place in the championship motocross competition by impersonating him. <em>Motocrossed</em> has always had a special place in my heart because it pointedly battles the ideas around women competing in sports stereotypically assigned to men. Andi was just as good as her brother, but people only took her seriously when she pretended to be him and the film does a great job in outlining the double standards in treatment, both on the field and within Andi's own family. <em>Halloweentown</em> may have introduced viewers to the zany and magical world of Debbie Reynolds\u2019 Aggie Cromwell, but <em>Halloweentown</em> <em>II: Kalabar\u2019s Revenge</em> expands it. On a visit to Halloweentown, Marnie is trapped there by Kalabar\u2019s son, who plans on turning all humans into the creatures they seemingly despise. Naturally, Marnie and her family work to stop him. <em>Halloweentown II</em> is a bit more mature and allows Marnie to develop her magic without relying so heavily on her grandmother. Marnie\u2019s powers also work to bridge the divide between the human world and Halloweentown by making the doorway accessible all year round. That way, she doesn\u2019t have to choose between being human and being a witch. It\u2019s the best of both worlds. Before Shia LaBeouf launched his big movie career and implored fans to \"just do it\" in a passionate <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2494398/the-most-popular-saturday-night-live-clips-on-snls-youtube-channel\">motivational speech</a>, he played Louis Stevens on Disney's <em>Even Stevens</em>. To wrap the series, the cast starred in <em>The Even Stevens Movie</em>, which followed them on a trip to a remote island that was actually a staged reality show in disguise. This movie is hilarious and parodies reality competition shows while centering the Stevens family and the often strenuous relationship between Louis and his sister, Christy Carlson Romano's Ren. <em>Saturday Night Live's</em> Tim Meadows plays the bitter reality show host who is ultimately beaten at his own game and even <em>Full House</em> vet Dave Coulier <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2495280/netflixs-fuller-house-has-a-premiere-date-candace-cameron-bure-and-costars-are-hyped\">makes an appearance</a>. There's no major lesson here, but the film is arguably the funniest of all the Disney Channel originals. The film follows Ryan Merriman's Kyle who, after trying to avoid Heritage Day, caves and asks his parents about his background. They avoid giving him a straight answer in the hope that he'll just continue blending in. However, when his lucky coin is stolen, his Irish family's heirloom, he starts turning into a leprechaun. He must find <em>Galavant</em> vet Timothy Omundson's Seamus McTiernan and win back his lucky coin. <em>The Luck of the Irish</em> is a great reminder that many Disney Channel original films had some good messages. It's exaggerated to make a point, but in trying to blend in, Kyle ignores his heritage instead of embracing it. He ultimately concedes that his Irish heritage doesn't make him any less American than anyone else and it's a good reminder that no one should hide who they are or feel ashamed just to fit in or make others feel comfortable. Two decades later and this Disney Channel original movie holds up so incredibly well. <em>Brink!</em> starred Erik von Detten \u2014 also known for having appeared alongside <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466260/anne-hathaway-shares-a-hopeful-princess-diaries-3-update\">Anne Hathaway in <em>The Princess Diaries</em></a> \u2014 as Andy \u201cBrink\u201d Brinker, a skater who takes up with his team\u2019s rivals to make money to help his family. The Disney Channel original thoughtfully established what it really meant to sell out and that it wasn't just about making money doing what you love. It was about the principle. What's more, <em>Brink!</em> also included a Mr. Feeny-like lesson about not defining yourself based on what you do in a lovely conversation between Brink and his dad. A classic. \"We're soaring\u2026 flying!\" Its premiere took viewers by storm, launched a franchise, and a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2482107/how-you-can-watch-the-high-school-musical-tv-show-before-the-disney-premiere\">Disney+ TV spinoff</a>. It's a simple enough premise: Zac Efron's Troy and Vanessa Hudgens' Gabriella meet in a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493697/5-things-about-grease-that-dont-make-any-sense\"><em>Grease-</em>style intro</a> and before long, they're auditioning for the school play. The problem? Troy and Gabriella's friends want them to stick to what they know and not shake up the status quo. <em>High School Musical's</em> songs are still classic (\"We're All in This Together\" is forever stuck in my head), the dance moves were on point, and the movie teaches an important lesson about the hindrance of labels and the relief of breaking free from the pressures of being anyone other than yourself. Before <em>High School Musical</em>, there was <em>The Cheetah Girls</em>. Produced by Whitney Houston, this Disney Channel original follows Raven-Simone's Galleria, Adrienne Bailon's Chanel, Kiely Williams' Aqua, and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2485730/frustrated-erin-andrews-defends-her-reaction-to-dancing-with-the-stars-2019-winners\"><em>Dancing with the Stars</em> alum</a> Sabrina Bryan's Dorinda. They're collectively known as the Cheetah Girls, a singing group who hopes to make it big. However, almost immediately after they're signed to a record label, the teens start growing apart, in conflict with how to proceed under new rules and pressures. <em>The Cheetah Girls</em> contains a host of original music and, after some ups and downs, the girl group decides to stick it out and work on their friendship instead of taking the deal. At the end of the day, the ladies remember that they're more important to each other than a career that would have them in conflict with each other. There are so many incredible and nostalgic Disney Channel original movies to choose from and there were a few that came close to making the list. That said, <em>Up, Up and Away</em>, <em>Smart House</em>, <em>Cadet Kelly</em>, and <em>Zenon: Girl from the 21st Century</em> deserve honorable mentions. All of these old school Disney Channel original movies are currently available to stream on <a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/\">Disney+</a>.

    "content": "<strong>Warning: SPOILERS for <em>Red Sparrow</em> are in play. If you haven't seen the film yet, bookmark this article and come back once you're current.</strong> As any good espionage thriller tends to do, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2315742/red-sparrow-review\"><em>Red Sparrow</em></a> engages in quite a few twists and turns throughout its narrative. In particular, the film's third act totally hinges on revelations and actions spurred on by the knowledge they contain, leading to a good portion of the film's finale winding through a spy's labyrinth of betrayal and success. Which is why it seems like a good idea for us to run through the major building blocks of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1829450/the-new-red-sparrow-trailer-is-brutal-but-thrilling\"><em>Red Sparrow's</em></a> shocking finale in order to help show the big picture of what happened, what it means, and why those moments were so surprising to start. So we'll give one last warning before going forward: once you've cleared the next paragraph, you are deep in spoiler country -- so jump out while you can. CIA agent Nate Nash has an informant in the Russian government, whom we see him botch a meeting with in the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/Red-Sparrow-70377.html\"><em>Red Sparrow</em></a>. After this compromising position, the Russians are curious as to the identity of their mole. It is then decided by Ivan Egorova to send his niece, and recent Sparrow School graduate, Dominika in to seduce and extract that information from Nate. Throughout the film, the key mystery at the heart is \"Who is MARBLE?\" -- the codenamed operative working with Nate to pass state secrets. Sure enough, in the third act, Dominika obtains this information from MARBLE himself, as he reveals his identity during her recovery from an attack sanctioned by her uncle and his superiors. The man who reveals himself to be MARBLE is Jeremy Irons' General Vladimir Korchnoi, one of the figures who we previously though was working against Dominika's efforts throughout <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2314941/jennifer-lawrence-got-comfortable-quickly-during-her-red-sparrow-nude-scene\"><em>Red Sparrow</em></a>. Korchnoi explains to Dominika that his efforts with the U.S. government are spurred on by a personal vendetta, as his terminally ill wife wasn't allowed treatment by an American doctor, leading to her ultimate demise. With his progressively crumbling allegiance fully shattered, Korchnoi aligned himself with the Americans, and ultimately suggests that Dominika reveal his secret to her uncle so that she can take his place as the new source of high ranking intelligence for the CIA. Soon after that, Dominika makes her play to give MARBLE up to her Russian superiors, although she puts a unique twist on her findings. As <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2306542/red-sparrow-super-bowl-trailer\"><em>Red Sparrow's</em></a> central mystery draws to a close, Dominika reports to the Russian Ambassador in Budapest that she knows MARBLE's identity. However, she will only report this knowledge to Colonel Zyuganov, the third member of the Russian trio handling Dominika. This knowledge then leads to a handoff between the CIA and Russian intelligence, to be set at an airfield in Budapest. It is there where it's revealed that Dominika framed her uncle Ivan as MARBLE, rather than give up Korchnoi as the real mole. We then see a flashback showing Dominika's previous actions of collecting a whiskey glass from Nate's apartment and opening a bank account in Vienna are now presented as they truly were: actions that helped plant evidence of her uncle's would-be treachery as revenge for forcing her into <a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/p/are-red-sparrows-real-the-new-jennifer-lawrence-movie-is-more-truth-than-fiction-8261557\">Sparrow School </a>in the first place. As they meet during the handoff, her uncle claims she's just about killed him, to which Dominika smiles and replies, \"Didn't I do well, Uncle?\" Ivan proceeds to make his way to the CIA's custody and is shot dead by a sniper stationed in the grass, while Dominika is rapidly whisked away to the helicopter waiting for her. After her retrieval from Budapest, Dominika returns home to Moscow, and we see her spending time with her sick mother. Of course, this safety comes from the fact that Dominika has now received a promotion and quite a bit of fanfare from the SVR for her efforts in outing her uncle as the supposed mole. We see her celebrated at a sort of press conference, with Korchnoi and the matron of the Sparrow School looking on with pride. Still, the final moments of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2306891/red-sparrow-jennifer-lawrences-spy-movie-is-getting-a-hard-r-rating\"><em>Red Sparrow</em></a> do indicate that the relationship between Dominika and Nate isn't completely dead, as she receives a phone call playing a familiar tune: the music she and Nate listened to on their first meeting. She looks out the window expectantly and smiles, leading us all to think that this story is only getting started. With two more books in the series, we couldn't be more right.

    "content": "Superhero movies definitely aren\u2019t hard to find in this day and age and, with so many having been released over the last several decades, it can be tough for some to choose their favorites. From Marvel and DC Comics-based features to projects adapted from <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546637/netflixs-the-old-guard-trailer-charlize-theron-rises-from-the-dead-and-kicks-ass-in-new-action-movie\">niche properties</a> like <em>Hellboy</em> and <em>Kick-Ass</em>, there are so many to consider. <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> director <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496380/after-rumors-swirl-about-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-james-gunn-sets-the-record-straight\">James Gunn</a> is certainly aware of just how many flicks are out there, yet he\u2019s managed to find his favorite. And it might not be what you\u2019re expecting. James Gunn has been participating in the 30-Day Film Challenge, an online challenge that asks fans to watch a certain kind of movie on a particular day. The 10th day of the challenge requires participants to watch their favorite superhero movie. Upon arriving on this day, Gunn tweeted out his choice, and it\u2019s an animated film that became a hit: Yes, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493314/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-filmmakers-reveal-the-crazy-process-that-got-the-movie-made\"><em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em></a> appears to be James Gunn\u2019s favorite superhero film. The director and cinephile has seen his fair share of them, so the fact that Spider-Verse is his favorite says a lot. It\u2019s honestly hard to disagree with Gunn\u2019s taste in superhero movies. Aside from receiving critical acclaim (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467388/2019-oscars-see-the-complete-list-of-academy-awards-winners\">including an Oscar win</a>), <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> is one of the most unique comic book adaptations to be released in the last decade. The film took the character of Miles Morales and told a story that covered themes, ranging from identity and purpose to sacrifice and family. It also managed to tickle moviegoers\u2019 funny bones with characters like <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467096/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-blu-ray-will-have-a-special-spider-ham-surprise\">John Mulaney\u2019s Spider-Ham</a> and Jake Johnson\u2019s scruffy, but heroic, Peter Parker. James Gunn isn\u2019t the only filmmaker to share their favorite superhero movies. <em>Doctor Strange</em>\u2019s Scott Derrickson previously <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottderrickson/status/997671900817051649\">declared</a> <em>Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut</em> as his favorite superhero movie. He even went as far as to call it the <em>Blade Runner</em> of superhero cinema. <em>Hellboy</em> helmer Guillermo del Toro is also a fan of the genre and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealGDT/status/1064286221252276229\">posted a list</a> of his favorite hero films a few years ago. The list contained a variety of flicks, including Sam Raimi\u2019s first two <em>Spider-Man</em> films, Richard Donner\u2019s <em>Superman</em> movies, <em>The Dark Knight</em>, <em>Wonder Woman</em> and Gunn\u2019s <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. It goes without saying that del Toro has great taste. With more superhero movies <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485429/comic-books-to-read-to-prepare-for-2020s-superhero-movies\">on the horizon</a> over the next few years, it\u2019s likely going to get even harder to pick favorites. This means James Gunn\u2019s preference could change with time. But given just how good Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is, there\u2019s a firm chance it\u2019ll remain at the top of his list.

    "title": "Harry Potter\u2019s J.K. Rowling Is Finally Giving Us Another Children's Story",
    "content": "Much to our surprise, J.K. Rowling has had an unpublished story in her attic for almost a decade. Like many of us the world\u2019s highest-earning author has been home a lot more than usual over the past couple months and even has <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493979/harry-potter-writer-jk-rowling-suspects-she-had-coronavirus\">a direct connection to the current health crisis</a>. Rowling has brushed off the dust on a children\u2019s story called <em>The Ickabog</em>, and she\u2019s publishing it this year. In a Tuesday announcement, J.K. Rowling revealed that a few chapters of <em>The Ickabog</em> will be released every weekday until mid-July. Her new story will be unravelled online for free ahead of <em>The Ickabog</em> hitting bookshelves in November. The first two chapters, titled \u201cKing Fred the Fearless\u201d and \u201cThe Ickabog\u201d (each about a page long), have already dropped on t<a href=\"https://www.theickabog.com/en-us/read-the-story/\">he official <em>Ickabog</em> website</a>. The best-selling author said she started drafting the story in between <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546787/harry-potters-jk-rowling-magically-dispels-some-rumors-about-making-the-series\">writing her <em>Harry Potter</em> book series</a> and had planned to publish it after <em>Deathly Hallows</em>. Instead, J.K. Rowling decided to take five years off from book publishing and ended up turning to the 2012 adult fiction novel <em>The Casual Vacancy</em>. As Rowling noted in <a href=\"http://www.jkrowling.com/j-k-rowling-introduces-the-ickabog/?fbclid=IwAR2sECqJ4kByaM6VRooi45g155syMZ60zkBBhvOaDAJqaRO1W3YB6okIDTo\">her official statement</a>, <em>The Ickabog</em> has remained alive through story time with her kids. Amidst self-isolation with her family, J.K. Rowling has decided to finally publish <em>The Ickabog</em>, especially in an effort to entertain the millions of children stuck in their homes due to global health concerns. Rowling is also launching an illustration competition to young readers as the chapters unfold. Winners will have their artwork published in the print edition of <em>The Ickabog</em> coming later this year. The <em>Harry Potter</em> author said the book is appropriate for kids aged 7 to 9 to read themselves, and explained the contents of <em>The Ickabog</em> with these words: <em>The Ickabog</em> does not take place in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496464/harry-potter-9-strange-things-that-happen-in-the-wizarding-world-we-just-accept\">the Wizarding World</a> or look to have any relation to <em>Harry Potter</em>. The words released so far introduce the ruler of a place called Cornucopia, a five-year old boy named Bert Beamish and the myth of a children and sheep-eating monster called The Ickabog.

    "content": "As a finished film, Michael Showalter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2472335/the-lovebirds\"><em>The Lovebirds</em></a> is a blast. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546669/newly-ripped-kumail-nanjiani-explains-why-he-took-his-eternals-physical-transformation-so-seriously\">Kumail Nanjiani</a> and Issa Rae make for a delightful pair of leads for the romantic comedy, and the adventure they\u2019re on is both <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496567/the-lovebirds-reviews-are-in-heres-what-critics-are-saying\">engaging and hilarious</a>. It\u2019s work that all involved can be proud of \u2013 but like any work, the experience making it had both real challenges in addition to wonderful, unique rewards. I had the pleasure of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546635/lovebirds-stars-kumail-nanjiani-and-issa-rae-name-two-movies-that-inspire-their-new-comedy\">interviewing the stars of <em>The Lovebirds</em></a> earlier this month, and my final question to the duo was a broad one, having them look back at the total experience of making the film, and single out some of their biggest takeaways. As you\u2019ll see clicking play on the video above, the process of making the movie wreaked a bit of havoc with the stars\u2019 circadian rhythms, but it also gave them the opportunity to explore one of the most special places in America: Part of what makes <em>The Lovebirds</em> impressive on a story level is the fact that it almost entirely takes place over the course of a single night \u2013 but the word \u201cnight\u201d is significant in that sentence because it required the production to operate odd hours. While anything set indoors could be shot at any time, the majority of sequences taking place outside had to be filmed after the sun had gone down. Working like that would mess with anybody, and Kumail Nanjiani acknowledged that it was a challenge for him in the making of the new move. Addressing the first half of my question, the actor explained, Considering that a great deal of the filmmaking process for an actor is patiently waiting around while also being consistently on call, it\u2019s easy to see how night shoots may drive a person a little batty. Fortunately, the exhaustion that was apparently felt behind the scenes isn\u2019t present in the movie at all (in fact, it\u2019s actually surprising how totally alert the characters are throughout their all-night adventure \u2013 though that could be attributed to the adrenaline rush that comes with trying to solve a murder while simultaneously dodging the police). Issa Rae agreed that doing all of the night shoots required for <em>The Lovebirds</em> wasn\u2019t overly pleasant, but felt that the scales were balanced by the fact that during the production they were living in a remarkable place: New Orleans. Unlike some films, which shoot in the Louisiana city but ultimately have it stand in for another location, the new comedy is actually set in the Big Easy, and Rae loved that making the movie gave her the chance to spend some real time there: It was a sentiment that was immediately echoed by Kumail Nanjiani, who was given his first chance to really explore New Orleans and embed himself in the special culture in possess: <em>The Lovebirds</em>, which co-stars Paul Sparks, Anna Camp, Moses Storm, and Kyle Bornheimer, is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493003/kumail-nanjiani-and-issa-raes-the-lovebirds-is-heading-to-netflix\">now streaming</a> on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494909/netflix-new-releases-movies-and-tv-shows-streaming-in-may-2020\">Netflix</a>.

    "title": "Tom Cruise's Space Movie With Elon Musk Has Taken A Big Step Forward",
    "content": "When you\u2019re someone as iconic as Tom Cruise, you know who the folks you love to work with truly are. And while the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> actor has built big relationships with directors like Christopher McQuarrie and Joseph Kosinski. when it comes to his new untitled space movie, Cruise has apparently tapped another frequent and beloved collaborator. <em>American Made</em> collaborator Doug Liman has been installed as the director of this Elon Musk-enhanced film. <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/05/doug-liman-tom-cruise-outer-space-movie-elon-musk-nasa-1202943591/\">Deadline</a> gained the inside tip on Doug Liman\u2019s hiring, as the man behind <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em> has been recruited to join Tom Cruise\u2019s team on this exciting new project. Seeing as this untitled project is the first blockbuster movie <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495646/tom-cruise-is-teaming-with-elon-musk-for-first-movie-to-be-shot-in-outer-space-because-of-course\">to be shot in outer space</a>, this pretty much makes Liman the first director to make such a film in the final frontier. Doug Liman\u2019s directing skills have been in the Tom Cruise rotation since the two teamed on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Edge-Tomorrow-6843.html\">the 2014 sci-fi success</a> that eventually came out of <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>. So right now\u2019s probably a good time to start addressing the mech suit in the room right now, as we have to ask whether or not the sequel we\u2019ve been <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2467717/looks-like-edge-of-tomorrow-2-is-finally-moving-forward\">waiting almost a decade for</a> is finally making some massive moves to becoming a reality. It\u2019s unfortunately hard to say yes or no for sure, as not only is this new film being kept close to the chest in terms of story details, but at the moment, it\u2019s an independent production. Without the backing of Warner Bros being announced, it sounds like this outer space caper is a fresh prospect rather than a follow-up to the adventures of Tom Cruise\u2019s Major Bill Cage. So <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492497/emily-blunt-shares-optimistic-hopes-for-the-edge-of-tomorrows-sequel\">unless Emily Blunt is randomly announced</a> as the next star on the picture, this is a possibility we\u2019ll shelve for the time being. Right now, all we know for sure is that Tom Cruise and Elon Musk\u2019s Space-X are teaming up to make this film, and NASA is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495718/how-nasa-responded-to-news-of-tom-cruises-space-movie\">apparently really jazzed about this project</a>. With Doug Liman\u2019s hiring as director, no further clues can be gleaned as to what this untitled space action-adventure movie is actually about. This film is obviously going to take some time to get into production, as naturally Tom Cruise\u2019s most immediate commitments belong to the next two <em>Mission: Impossible</em> sequels. But on the other side of the equation, oug iman has his own project to bring on home, as his long-suffering film <em>Chaos Walking</em> is prepared to lose its previous branding <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489868/that-unreleasable-daisy-ridley-tom-holland-movie-chaos-walking-finally-got-a-release-date\">as an \u201cunreleaseable\u201d film</a> in January 2021. More specifically, you can see <em>Chaos Walking</em> when it\u2019s released on January 22, 2021; provided, of course, that the massive <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495513/john-wick-4-spiral-and-more-just-got-new-release-dates\">shuffling of the Lionsgate release schedule</a> doesn\u2019t change those plans in the near future.

Even as a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546618/henry-cavills-infamous-mustache-returned-for-zack-snyders-man-of-steel-watch-party-and-fans-cant-get-enough\">mustachioed Henry Cavill joined</a> Zack Snyder to reveal the upcoming exciting return of the Man of Steel for the filmmaker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496562/release-the-snyder-cut-zack-snyders-justice-league-going-to-hbo-max\">long-awaited version of <em>Justice League</em> coming to HBO Max</a>, Warner Bros is technically at a stand still with Kal-El. There have been a ton of Superman projects that were in the works at one time but never made it far enough into production. What's surprising is the amount of esteemed filmmakers that have been at the center of these scrapped projects on the hero in the past 30 years. Let's go through them: Back in the early \u201890s after <em>The Death of Superman</em> comic book crossover event made waves, Warner Bros was shopping for a comeback for the superhero. The studio purchased the storyline from DC and hired Jonathan Lemkin (<em>Devil\u2019s Advocate, Lethal Weapon 4</em>) to write a script. Lemkin came up with a storyline that involved Superman losing a massive fight with Doomsday. Just as he reaches his death, his life force goes through Lois Lane and she ends up being impregnated with his child through virgin birth. Yes. This was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-jul-21-fi-superman21-story.html\">an actual</a> Superman script. Lois\u2019 child quickly grows into an adult in the matter of a few weeks as a resurrected Superman who finishes the job for Sups. Warner Bros reportedly passed on the script because it had too many similarities with Bruce\u2019s arc in <em>Batman Forever</em>, according to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Greatest-Sci-fi-Movies-Revised-Expanded/dp/1845767551\"><em>The Greatest Sci-fi Movies Never Made</em></a>. Hey I don\u2019t see it, but there you have it, that's the story of why <em>Superman Reborn</em> never got past the script process. Script-writing duties were then placed into the hands of Kevin Smith, who had broken out with <em>Clerks</em> and <em>Mallrats</em> at the time. His film called <em>Superman Lives</em> also included Doomsday, but under the orders of Brainiac and Lex Luthor. The villains outsmart Superman by blocking the Sun (the source of his powers) from him. But he is then resurrected by the Eradicator, a Kryptonian robot, and becomes sheathed in a robotic suit to take down Brainiac. Following his work on the <em>Batman</em> movies, Tim Burton was hired to direct the script and Nicolas Cage came on board to play Superman. Smith had originally thought up Ben Affleck for the role and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494824/kevin-smith-had-a-mallrats-actor-in-mind-to-play-lex-luthor-in-superman-lives\">some other frequent collaborators</a> in key roles such as Michael Rooker as Lex Luthor and Jason Mewes as Brainiac. Big names such as Kevin Spacey, Sandra Bullock and Chris Rock were ultimately approached, but it was later put on hold for being too expensive. Burton moved on to <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> and its since become <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1722030/one-huge-thing-tim-burtons-superman-lives-wanted-to-explore-about-the-dc-hero\">one of the most famous movies</a> that never happened. Wolfgang Peterson, the director of <em>Das Boot</em> and <em>Outbreak</em> was once attached to making a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Batman-V-Superman-Dawn-Justice-69647.html\">previous <em>Batman vs. Superman</em> team-up</a> film in 2001 based off an idea from <em>Seven</em> writer Andrew Kevin Walker. The pitch followed a newly divorced Superman and a newlywed Batman, who has lost Robin, Alfred and Gordan and hung up his cape. When the Joker murders his new wife, Bruce blames his best man Sups for heartbreak and a rivalry forms. It was set to shoot in 2003 ahead of its summer 2004 release date before Warner Bros changed their minds and decided to focus on independent <em>Batman</em> and <em>Superman</em> projects. Wolfgang Petersen revealed that Christian Bale was <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2596246/christian-bale-superman-wolfgang-petersen-batman-vs-superman/\">in the running for Superman to MTV back in 2010</a>. One writer Akiva Goldsman decided to add a fun Easter Egg in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2308941/why-i-am-legend-didnt-need-a-sequel-according-to-the-director\"><em>I Am Legend</em></a> for the cancelled film: a poster of the logo (peek the above image). Before he did <em>Star Trek</em> or <em>Star Wars</em> and even before <em>LOST</em>, J.J. Abrams almost wrote a Superman movie. Back in 2002, Abrams was hired to write a new origin movie for Clark Kent following his early success with <em>Armageddon</em>, <em>Felicity</em> and <em>Alias</em>. At first his script was put on hold for the <em>Batman vs. Superman</em> script, but once he turned in a rewrite then the former was placed on hold. <em>Rush Hour</em> director Brett Ratner was hired to direct, Christopher Reeve was put on as a consultant and actors including Paul Walker, Brendan Fraser and Jude Law were considered. The script kept Krypton standing after Kal-El\u2019s journey to Earth. It centered on Jor-El\u2019s evil brother Kata-Zor who sends Jor-El to prison and launches his son to Earth. Once Superman becomes popular on the planet, Kata-Zor and three of his partners venture to Earth to defeat him. Clark dies and finds himself with his dad Jor-El in Kryptonian heaven (who committed suicide in prison). Superman somehow gets resurrected and goes back to Earth to finish the job. Over the years, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pramsey342/status/1141933812651184129\">some awesome storyboards</a> have been revealed about the project that never was. Ratner left due to casting difficulties and <em>Charlie\u2019s Angels</em>\u2019 director McG came on board before Bryan Singer was replaced to make 2006\u2019s <em>Superman Returns</em>. <em>Superman Returns</em> made some money for Warner Bros, but not enough for the studio to pursue the planned 2009 sequel <em>Superman Returns 2: The Man of Steel</em>. Months before the release of <em>Superman Returns</em>, the sequel was announced with the core cast set to return and Bryan Singer back as director. The movie was expected to finally bring Brainiac to the big screen and introduce Metallo. Singer instead went on to make <em>Valkyrie</em> instead and plans for Christopher Nolan\u2019s <em>Man of Steel</em> reboot began to take shape. Brandon Routh never got to reprise his version of Kal-El in another movie, but the actor did recently <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2485794/brandon-routh-is-golden-era-superman-for-the-arrow-verses-crisis-on-infinite-earths-crossover\">resume the role in Arrowverse\u2019s <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em> crossover event in 2019</a> alongside <em>Smallville\u2019s</em> Tom Welling. Another especially high-profile Superman project that never happened is George Miller\u2019s <em>Justice League: Mortal</em>. The movie to be directed by the <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> filmmaker was also in development following <em>Superman Returns</em> and would have offered a fresh new take on the superhero genre. D.J. Cotrona was hired to play Superman, Armie Hammer was to be Batman, Megan Gale as Wonder Woman, Adam Brody as Flash, Common as Green Lantern, Hugh Keays-Byrne as Martian Manhunter, Jay Baruchel as Maxwell Lord and Teresa Palmer would play Talia Al Ghul. Cotrona described it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/What-We-Missed-George-Miller-Justice-League-Movie-Was-Cancelled-74977.html\">allegorical, like a story of Greek Gods</a>\u201d and <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2478159/george-millers-justice-league-adam-brody-says-losing-it-still-hurts-knows-it-would-have-been-a-classic\">Brody thinks it would have \u201cbeen a classic.\u201d</a> This movie fell through the cracks due to ill timing. Warner Bros wanted more work to be done on the script just as the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike was in effect. Oddly enough, Cotrona and Brody both suited up in the third act of <em>Shazam!</em> As adult superhero versions of Billy Batson\u2019s adopted brothers. It took seven years between <em>Superman Returns</em> and <em>Man of Steel</em>, but many would agree it was worth the wait. Henry Cavill was an incredible choice for the role and Zack Snyder\u2019s vision for the character was an exciting one. In 2014, a sequel was announced to be in the works (with the potential of George Miller helming even a possibility). It was reported that <em>Man of Steel</em> was part of a three-film arc until plans to bring <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> and <em>Justice League</em> took priority over another standalone flick. Back in 2018, it was rumored that <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2457413/henry-cavill-may-be-leaving-superman-and-the-dc-movies\">Henry Cavill was done with the DC universe</a> and other comic book projects were being moved ahead of another <em>Man of Steel</em> movie. In late 2019, Cavill <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2485156/henry-cavill-isnt-giving-up-on-superman-just-yet\">assured fans that he has \u201cnot given up the role\u201d</a> and updated the status of the hero\u2019s future as \u201cyou\u2019ll see\u201d. The actor does have a packed schedule between <em>The Witcher</em> and an upcoming <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> film, but perhaps the character will find regained interest with 2021\u2019s release of Snyder Cut?

    "content": "The spring season is typically one of ceremony, celebration \u2013 crowded stadiums filled with family and friends who are proud of the year\u2019s high school and college graduates. With the ongoing world health crisis , the Class of 2020 is having a completely different experience this year. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495950/arnold-schwarzeneggers-latest-isolation-update-has-cigars-stretching-and-one-hilarious-surprise\"><em>Terminator</em> actor Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> recently took some time to address recent graduates by offering some blunt, yet valuable life advice. In his words: These are wise words from the former California governor and iconic action star, who summed up the points he wanted to get across in his recent speech when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03Z5moETAHU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">catching up with Jimmy Fallon</a> on another at-home edition of <em>The Tonight Show</em>. If you're curious about what he said during the entire address to the students, give it a watch below. Arnold Schwarzenegger started his speech by being honest with the recent graduates from around the world his video reached. It\u2019s really not the best time to graduate. It\u2019s true, a lot more people are out of a job today than a few months ago, but as he stated, their success cannot be erased. During the nearly 12-minute address, Arnold Schwarzenegger detailed the big obstacle he experienced just months before shooting <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2482802/terminator-dark-fate-review-finally-this-franchise-is-back-with-a-good-movie\"><em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em></a>. During a routine physical with his doctor, he was told his heart valve needed to be replaced. Since the procedure could be done through a non-invasive surgery, Schwarzenegger agreed to go through it while he was in the middle for training to reprise his T-800 role. However, there were complications that led the surgery to become an invasive one. When ArnoldSchwarzenegger woke up, he learned that his doctors had just saved his life and he wasn\u2019t out of the woods yet. The actor had to use a walker to get around just months before filming intense fight sequences on <em>Terminator: Dark Fate</em>. As Schwarzenegger proudly told, his clear vision for himself allowed him to recover and make his summer shooting schedule on time. The actor\u2019s inspiring message to graduates comes after addresses from the likes of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495616/tom-hanks-has-a-great-commencement-message-for-college-students-graduating-during-pandemic\">America's \"dad\" Tom Hanks</a>, Ryan Reynolds\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495695/of-course-ryan-reynolds-made-fun-of-green-lantern-during-his-commencement-speech'\">funny message to his alma mater</a>, Brad Pitt\u2019s shoutout that mostly <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546624/brad-pitt-has-a-message-for-college-grads-but-his-hair-gets-the-attention\">had fans talking about his new haircut</a>, and one from <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496373/wonder-woman-1984s-gal-gadot-gives-inspiring-speech-to-class-of-2020\">Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot</a>. Arnold Schwarzenegger has been particularly vocal during the global pandemic by advising his fans to stay at home, selling masks and shirts for charity, and posting cute updates with his pet donkey and mini pony.

For <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2486984/cats-jason-derulo-is-125-percent-sure-his-penis-was-removed-via-cgi\">well-endowed <em>Cats</em> star Jason Derulo</a>, he recently decided to spend some time putting together a mini-Spider-Man origin story within his home's walls. Check out the man who played Rum Tum Tigger on the big screen last year suddenly obtaining the ability to do whatever a spider can below: Taking part in the \u201cWipe It Down\u201d challenge, here we have Jason Derulo cleaning off a full body mirror when he\u2019s suddenly bitten by a dropping spider (that\u2019s a nice use of footage from 2002\u2019s <em>Spider-Man</em>). Within seconds, Derulo finds himself wearing a Spider-Man costume and spinning webs just like the ol\u2019 Wall-Crawler. After a quick celebratory dance, the singer hightails it out of the room with one of Spidey\u2019s patented web pulls. I gotta say, for a <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@jasonderulo/video/6830143853249563910\">Tik Tok video</a>, this has some pretty good production value, and now I\u2019m curious how Jason Derulo would do playing an adult Miles Morales in a live-action movie. And hey, while we\u2019ve seen many iterations of cinematic Spider-Man costumes over nearly two decades, the one that kicked off the lineup, the Tobey Maguire-worn suit, remains a classic. Although Jason Derulo played himself in an episode of <em>Empire</em> in 2015, he played his first fictional character on an episode of fellow Fox series <em>Lethal Weapon</em> the following year. Last year\u2019s <em>Cats</em>, however, marked Derulo\u2019s biggest acting gig yet, as he appeared alongside folks like James Corden, Ian McKellen, Idris Elba, Judi Dench, Jennifer Hudson, Rebel Wilson and many more. Alas, as so many of you know all too well, <em>Cats</em> was a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2487409/cats-jason-derulo-responds-to-the-movies-viral-reviews\">critical and commercial bomb</a>, ranking at 21% among critics on Rotten Tomatoes and making only $73 million worldwide. So that wasn\u2019t the greatest platform for Jason Derulo to give his film start, but he\u2019s keeping that proverbial train going with <em>Spinning Gold</em>, which will explore the life of record producer Neil Bogart. As for Spider-Man, the superhero has been keeping a big screen presence in recent years through both the live-action and animated realms. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Meet-Spider-Man-Tom-Holland-9-Awesome-Things-Know-About-Him-112757.html\">Tom Holland has held the webbed mantle</a> in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2016, and 2018\u2019s <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> chronicled Miles Morales\u2019 origin story, where he learned how to be a superhero from an alternate universe Peter Parker and various other Spider-heroes. Tom Holland\u2019s Spider-Man will return when his third MCU-set solo movie <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495105/two-spider-man-movies-just-got-pushed-back\">swings into theaters on November 5, 2021</a>, and <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2</em> is scheduled to come out on October 7, 2022.

    "title": "Wait, Are Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League And The Fabled Snyder Cut Really The Same Thing?",
    "content": "I will freely and openly admit that I was one of the people who never truly believed we\u2019d ever find ourselves here. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t <em>want</em> to see the Zack Snyder original cut of <em>Justice League</em>. I did, it\u2019s simply that I thought there were too many reasons why we wouldn\u2019t see it. And yet, here we are: <em>Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League</em> is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496562/release-the-snyder-cut-zack-snyders-justice-league-going-to-hbo-max\">a real thing coming to HBO Max next year</a>. Except is it really? While we don\u2019t have any real confirmation of exactly what <em>Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League</em> is going to look like on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2483810/will-hbo-max-rule-streaming-in-2020?pv=search\">HBO Max</a>, the reports have been that what we\u2019re getting could either be a movie that\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496562/release-the-snyder-cut-zack-snyders-justice-league-going-to-hbo-max?pv=search\">four hours long</a>, or it might be broken up into multiple episodes and released as a sort of limited series. This is an interesting idea to say the least, and those who have been fighting for the Snyder Cut to see the light of day deserve to call it a win, as this certainly wouldn\u2019t have happened without them. But something that is upwards of four hours long, doesn\u2019t seem like exactly what fans were actually looking for. At this point, it feels like the Snyder Cut <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493072/justice-league-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-snyder-cut?pv=search\">needs no explanation</a>, but perhaps it does need context. The entire movement sprung up around a simple, and perfectly valid, idea. By anybody\u2019s argument, the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/1722630/justice-league-review?pv=search\">theatrical release of <em>Justice League</em></a> was a jumbled mess. It combined aspects of both Zack Snyder\u2019s original work and a collection of extensive reshoots that were not only directed by another director (Joss Whedon), but written by him as well. Maybe the combination works for you, maybe it doesn't, but what the movie certainly <em>wasn't</em> was the singular vision of its director, as movies generally are. The feeling was that if Zack Snyder had been given the chance to complete the film that he wanted to make, it would have been something quite different, and quite possibly better. Even if it wasn't, fans still wanted to see the movie that Zack Snyder wanted to make. The thing is, if we could turn back the clock and Zack Snyder could have been given the chance to finish <em>Justice League</em> his way, wouldn\u2019t the end result have been a pretty standard theatrically-released movie of something in the neighborhood of two-hours long? Theatrical movies can certainly have a wide range of run times, but generally speaking ,a movie you\u2019ll find in theaters is no shorter than about 90 minutes. On the high end, we've started to see more mainstream movies, i.e. films of the blockbuster variety, creep up above the two hour mark, but they frequently fall somewhere tween two and two and a half hours. When <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> clocked in at <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464050/the-avengers-endgame-runtime-appears-to-be-set?pv=search\">three hours long</a>, it was kind of a big deal. It happened, and it worked, but any movie that hits three hour mark is running risks. There are some real and practical reasons why movies tend to hit these normal 90-120 minute run times. Audiences can potentially be turned off by a movie they feel is too long. In addition, and much more importantly, there are only so many times a day a three hour-plus movie can be run in a theater. Both of these things mean that longer movies run the risk of taking a box office hit, so studios tend to not be fans. Movies are art, but they're also a business, and every director, including Zack Snyder, understands this. Back in December, Zack Snyder released an i<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2487484/zack-snyder-admits-hes-tired-of-people-who-say-snyder-cut-doesnt-exist\">mage of film canisters</a> as a way to prove that the Snyder Cut existed. He also gave the movie a runtime: <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2487484/zack-snyder-admits-hes-tired-of-people-who-say-snyder-cut-doesnt-exist?pv=search\">214 minutes</a>, or about three and a half hours. Now is it possible that Zack Snyder fully intended to release a three and a half hour <em>Justice League</em> movie into theaters in November 2017? Sure it is. Is it possible Warner Bros. was cool with that? Again, yes, it's possible, though less likely. What\u2019s more likely, however, is that this three hour-plus movie, which hadn\u2019t been through reshoots yet, was going to see some edits from Snyder himself (of course) before it actually hit theaters. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493645/zack-snyders-batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-watch-party-available-in-its-entirety?pv=search\"><em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em></a> clocked in at two and a half hours long in its theatrical cut, and so seeing a <em>Justice League</em> movie a full hour longer than that seems unlikely. Zack Snyder would have known such a film wasn't going to fly, and so the man, who is not an idiot, would have been working toward a smaller film, in length if not in scope. If what you wanted was a movie that you could directly compare to the existing <em>Justice League</em>, something that would allow you to go through it and see exactly what pieces were added or changed, and what scenes were cut, then this version of \"the Snyder Cut\" is really the movie you were asking for. But the movie in those film canisters isn't that movie. This movie appears to be more akin to the Ultimate Edition of <em>Dawn of Justice</em>, which added 30 minutes to the movie and, by all accounts, is a superior version of the film. The movie in those canisters looks to be the \"director's cut\" of <em>Justice League</em>, i.e. the version that Snyder would make if he could include everything in it that he wanted to without having to worry about any other factors. If what you wanted wasn\u2019t a true comparison to the <em>Justice League</em> we got, but Zack Snyder\u2019s complete vision of what he wanted <em>Justice League</em> to be, then the 214 minute cut is the movie you\u2019ve been waiting for. That's \"the Snyder cut.\" And yet, what we\u2019re getting under the heading <em>Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League</em> may still be something else; a separate third thing that isn't the movie we would have actually seen in theaters in 2017 or an extended version of that. If it really does clock in at four hours or more, then this is an entirely different approach to <em>Justice League</em>. That\u2019s not a bad thing. It can still be amazing, but it\u2019s not really the Snyder Cut then, is it? I said at the outset that I never really thought the Snyder Cut would happen, but I was always curious. Few have argued that the version of <em>Justice League</em> we got was mostly the work of Joss Whedon, and thus seeing another director's take on the material was quite exciting from an academic point of view. How would another filmmaker, given the same setup and the same actors in the same roles, picking up from the same events following <em>Man of Steel</em> and <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em>, make a different movie? How could the scenes actually filmed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Snyder\">Zack Snyder</a> the first time around potentially be given an entirely different context by being surrounded by other scenes we never saw? Being able to compare and contrast the two movies is the sort of scenario that we've never had before, and likely will never get again. But if <em>Zack Snyder's Justice League</em> ends up being six hours long, we can't really compare them. This version, if it's really what we're getting, will, by its nature, give characters more time to develop and will give the plot more depth. It will simply be able to do more than the theatrical version of the movie ever could have, regardless of who the director was. It will be all but impossible to compare the two versions of <em>Justice League</em>. If the point of this whole exercise was to see if Snyder's version would have been better, we'll never really know. And that, of course, is the point. Releasing anything that's even vaguely comparable to the original <em>Justice League</em> is a no-win scenario for Warner Bros. If we got a two hour-ish version of Zack Snyder's version of <em>Justice League</em> and the movie was truly demonstrably better that the version that was released, then the studio looks foolish for spending the time and money to change it. If the new version was seen to be even only slightly better, or god forbid, worse, then Warner Bros looks equally foolish for having spent the time and money necessary to complete this alternate version. There's also the fact that a lot of time has passed, and Zack Snyder has been through a lot in the last couple of years. Is he the same man, the same director, that he was then? This isn't a question of being better or worse, but simply different. At the same time, opinions about the original <em>Justice League</em> are out there. Zack Snyder knows better than anybody what aspects of the original movie were his, and if some of the criticism of the original film were in regards to that, isn't it possible that, even if it's entirely subconscious, the director could approach those things differently this time around? Even if things like the format and length were the same, is the version of <em>Justice League</em> Zack Snyder would have made three years ago truly identical to the version he would make today? <em>Zack Snyder's Justice League</em> is certainly still going to be a highly anticipated, and potentially interesting, piece of media. I'm still looking forward to seeing it, but for a variety of reasons, I feel like we won't really ever know what the Snyder Cut could have been.

You can</em> <a href=\"https://privateinternetaccess.com/offer/cine_6u38suzri\"><em>sign up for the package with PIA here.</em></a> Though it's hard to find absolute truth in cinema, even in documentaries, the movies that are rooted in some sort of realism or reality can become the most intriguing and the most investing, especially when you know that what you're seeing on the screen is based \u2014 or, at least, partially inspired \u2014 by true events. Indeed, while some of these movies take more liberties with their real-life inspirations compared to others, there are several movies out there based on true stories (a notation you've probably seen once-or-twice before in front of movies), and there are several movies currently available on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/netflix\">Netflix</a> that derived from real people or real events. In fact, some of these titles are among the best movies on Netflix, and that's no lie. Here are some movies you should stream if you love movies based on true stories and/or real-life people. In truth, there were several creative liberties taken with David Fincher's <em>The Social Network</em>. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's <em>The Accidental Billionaires</em>, this dramatized retelling of the birth of Facebook, and what inspired one of the biggest, most prominent social media platforms on the planet, provides a <em>Citizen Kane</em>-esque look at one of our most influential media moguls. It explores the reasons why he made it and how personal failures inspire professional fortunes \u2014 even if they don't provide true happiness along the way. Whether or not Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin truly got to the heart of Mark Zuckerberg's real-life character doesn't take away from the movie's impeccable craftsmanship. It's <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Social-Network-4832.html\">a brilliant, expertly-made character study</a> into one of our most controversial contemporary figures. Much like Facebook, what is presented may not always be accurate, but it paints a hell of a picture. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70132721\">here</a>. Admittedly, 2018's darkly satirical <em>The Death of Stalin</em> doesn't exactly cling tight to the facts. A cinematic recreation of the turbulent series of events that transpire whenever Soviet leader Joseph Stalin dies in 1953, the newest film from writer/director Armando Iannucci (<em>Veep</em>) picks a tricky topic to explore comedy, but he does so richly and hilariously, dishing out several scathing laugh-out-loud moments of political anarchy, ruthless insults, and flagrant machismo that occur whenever this Russian leader unexpectedly passes away and the nation must figure out its next step. If you're not a fan of bitterly funny humor, this one might not appeal to you. But with its sharp writing and its excellent ensemble, notably with Steve Buscemi, Jason Isaacs, and more doing top-tier work, <em>The Death of Stalin</em> squeezes as much humorously life as it can out of this morbid premise. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80208631\">here.</a> Director Paul Greengrass is extremely effective at capturing a sense of intense realism in his films. Whether it's his <em>Bourne</em> sequels or cinematic re-creations of real-life events, like <em>Captain Phillips</em>, Greengrass is known to capture a gritty, intensely grounded authenticity in his best work. That's certainly the case with 2006's <em>United 93</em>. A dramatic portrayal of the events that took place abroad flight <em>United 93</em>, one of the hijacked planes during September 11th, 2001, Greengrass' film presents a nearly real-time examination of what these American passengers faced in this frightening, perilous moment, making the ultimate sacrifices to protect thousands of American lives \u2014 even if their own lives are taken in the process. While we don't know what exactly went down in that hijacked plane on 9/11, Greengrass provides a vivid, sobering and powerful recreation of this tragic day in U.S. history. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70048592\">here.</a> The transitional period between two popes is fascinating, fertile narrative ground to explore. Certainly, Anthony McCarten's <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489678/who-should-win-best-adapted-screenplay-at-the-2020-oscars-according-to-cinemablend\">Oscar-nominated screenplay</a> is speculative in <em>The Two Popes,</em> imagining instead of knowing what discussions were had between these two towering, monumental figures of the Catholic Church. Nevertheless, <em>The Two Popes</em> is an engrossing, even entertaining look at what defines the legacies of these two men, exploring the humanity in these men-of-God and getting to the heart of what represents their time (or future time) in this pivotal priesthood position. Anchored by strong performances from Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins, <em>The Two Popes</em> is given rich visual life from director Fernando Meirelles, invigorating a tale of two men chit-chatting with distinctive imagery and striking visual metaphors. How close this back-and-forth dialogue is to the truth isn't known, but what difference does it make when it's this accessible? <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/watch/80174451?source=35\">here</a>. There are several rock biopics that don't have the same spark and energy as their real-life inspirations. There's no sense getting into examples, but it's not hard to find many movies in this genre that don't quite match the epic heights of the bands they're trying to pay tribute to. While <em>The Runaways</em> doesn't reach the same heights as the 1970s band of the same name, it does contain their exhilarating electricity in the right moments. Anchored by strong performances from Kristen Stewart as the legendary Joan Jett and Dakota Fanning as Cherie Currie, <em>The Runaways</em> has enough punk-rock energy to honorably tell the story of this trendsetter band. Based on Currie's book <em>Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway</em>, <em>The Runaways</em> avoids a number of biopic tropes and clunky story beats, capturing the joy and enthusiasm of the band's ever-popular music. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/search?q=run&amp;jbv=70123100&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0\">here.</a> Journalism might not seem like an especially cinematic profession, admittedly, but there are more-than-a-few films that have given the profession life on the screen. One somewhat recent example that didn't get its full due is <em>Kill the Messenger,</em> which stars Jeremy Renner as Gary Webb, a San Jose Mercury News reporter <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Ray-Liotta-Helps-Whistleblower-Jeremy-Renner-Kill-Messenger-39051.html\">who investigates the CIA's role</a> in getting cocaine into the United States in the 1980s in order to get both money and weapons to freedom fighters in Nicaragua. This information is explosive, but also dangerous. It's the biggest story of Webb's career, but reporting it without turning a few heads won't be easy. Based on the book of the same name by Nick Schou and Webb's book, <em>Dark Alliance</em>, <em>Kill the Messenger</em> is the type of movie that makes journalism pulpy and engaging. It also features one of Renner's best performances. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80013772\">here.</a> In 1971, psychological professor Philip Zimbardo conducted an experiment where eighteen male students participated in a 14-day prison simulation where they either became a prisoner or guard. In the mock prison, the roles are assigned somewhat arbitrarily, but the results are almost immediate. As reality and fiction blur and the simulation seems like reality, the guards act morally superior and become abusive towards their fellow students \u2014 simply because they got one title over the other. The controversial real-life experiment became revealing in many of the worst ways, providing a harrowing, haunting framework through which director Kyle Patrick Alvarez makes a chilling, relentless drama based on this true story. Through its stark storytelling, immersive performances, and taunt filmmaking, <em>The Stanford Prison Experiment</em> is challenging, but it's an entirely stirring film about the dangers of ill-moral power dynamics \u2014 perceived or otherwise. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80038159\">here.</a> In 2008, the world was heartbroken to learn about David Foster Wallace's suicide. The best-selling <em>Infinite Jest</em> author was a wise, even mythic figure in late 20th/early 21st century literature, serving as a source of envy and wonder among writers everywhere. Certainly, while Wallace <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Jason-Segel-Makes-Bid-Oscar-Attention-With-End-Tour-Trailer-71689.html\">wasn't shy</a> about putting his thoughts to paper, only a few folks had the opportunity to dig into the late author's psyche and explore the ponderous recesses of his mind. But that was a privilege given to David Lipsky, a Rolling Stone reporter who got the chance to interview the subject over the course of several in-depth conversations. Their discussions were detailed and fleshed out in Lipsky's memoir, <em>Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself,</em> then adapted into 2015's poignant <em>The End of the Tour,</em> which offers <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/10-Great-Pieces-Advice-About-Writing-From-Beloved-Movie-Characters-79087.html\">thoughtful commentary</a> on legacies and the human condition. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80037478\">here</a>. You know <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Mike-Tyson-Bruce-Lee-Joining-Forces-Ip-Man-3-70530.html\">Bruce Lee</a>. But do you know the story of Ip Man, the martial artist who trained him? If you don't, or even if you do, you should check out the 2008 biopic of the same name, which chronicles the life story of the martial arts grandmaster, particularly as he battled poverty and briefly forgoes his life work to provide for his family, and eventually train others in self-defense, as tensions mount during the Japanese invasion of 1937. While the biopic tropes can be a little clunky at times, there's no denying <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493896/kill-bill-and-9-other-great-martial-arts-movies-available-streaming\">the majesty and exuberance of the fight sequences</a>, all of which are stunningly choreographed and expertly performed. But even beyond the exciting action scenes and set pieces, the film is carried by Donnie Yen's sincere, touching performance. It's easy to see why this film franchise was so successful for him. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70118799\">here.</a> Oftentimes, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494909/netflix-new-releases-movies-and-tv-shows-streaming-in-may-2020\">war movies</a> showcase the valor, the hardships, and the glamor of fighting tough battles, as well as the courageous bravery that comes with selfless acts of potential\u2014 or actualized \u2014sacrifice for the freedom of others. Rarely do we get many war movies quite like <em>Jarhead</em>, based Anthony Swofford's 2003 memoir, which explores his time as a marine in the Gulf War. Rather than watch the fearless triumphs that come with serving your country, director Sam Mendes witnesses the mundane and the isolation found from fighting in a war you might not understand or comprehend \u2014even when you're in the trenches. Instead of paying tribute to noble fallen heroes, <em>Jarhead</em> opts to study the blistering humanity of these young, sometimes aimless men lounging in the hot sun, looking for answers for their war-driven efforts or what they want to do with their listless lives. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/70021659\">here.</a> In the role that helped pave the way for her incredible acting career, Cate Blanchett explores the early years of Queen Elizabeth I in <em>Elizabeth</em>, the acclaimed film where Blanchett got her first Oscar nomination. Exploring the difficult task of becoming a monarch and how it shaped her legacy, the drama has cinematography, art direction, music, costume design, and make-up, for which it won an Oscar. But it hinges on Blanchett's performance, and she does an outstanding job of communicating the nuanced struggles that come from taking on this powerful position, especially at an early age. Bringing a great deal of international acclaim for the noteworthy actress, much like Queen Elizabeth I herself, it'd be the start of an astonishing career. She reprised the role in 2008's <em>Elizabeth: The Golden Age,</em> but it unfortunately wasn't as good \u2014 though it's also available on Netflix. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/17236680\">here</a>. Following his decades of screenwriting and show-running, working with directors like David Fincher and Danny Boyle, Aaron Sorkin finally stepped into the director's chair himself with <em>Molly's Game</em>. Based on the memoir of the same name by Molly Bloom, this biographical crime-drama sees our title character (Jessica Chastain) become the target of an FBI investigation after her underground poker empire is exposed. Providing yet another tale of a true figure hoping to prove themselves and reach for greatness in a competitive, even dangerous field, <em>Molly's Game</em> hits many beats you'd expect from a Sorkin joint, and it plays around with fact and fiction as the screenwriter-turned-filmmaker did with <em>Steve Jobs</em> and the aforementioned <em>The Social Network</em>. But while this pulpy, entertaining tale doesn't hit greatness, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493948/movies-to-stream-if-you-like-the-social-network\">it captures a similar whiz-bang charm</a>. Plus, the sharp dialogue, complemented by strong performances, really seals the deal. <strong>Stream It On Netflix</strong> <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/search?q=molly%27s%20game&amp;jbv=80199959&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0\">here</a>.

    "content": "The <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2474400/every-jason-bourne-movie-ranked\"><em>Bourne</em> franchise</a> has faced more blows in recent years as Matt Damon has started to move away from the property.

Following writer/director Paul Greengrass\u2019 longtime contributions to the franchise (including 2016\u2019s <em>Jason Bourne</em>, which brought back Matt Damon), the producer is looking for fresh blood to bring their own vision to the famed action franchise. Back in 2019, <em>Treadstone</em> executive producer Ben Smith said the studio was \u201d<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481543/another-bourne-movie-is-in-the-works-and-itll-tie-into-the-treadstone-tv-show\">definitely working on another film</a>\u201d that would be \u201cconcurrent\u201d with the television show. Following the show\u2019s cancellation at USA Network, it\u2019s unlikely the same plans are underway. The show attempted to touch on the origins of Treadstone, but amid NBCUniversal\u2019s programming shifts toward a strategy relying heavily on unscripted shows, that story is now over. The question is if the Bourne franchise will pick back up without Matt Damon and if <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2482458/does-the-next-jason-bourne-movie-need-to-have-matt-damon-to-succeed\">can succeed presumably without the actor</a>? When Jeremy Renner took on the leading role in 2012\u2019s <em>The Bourne Legacy</em>, it pulled the worst numbers for a <em>Bourne</em> sequel: $276 million globally against a budget of $125 million. When Matt Damon was reattached to the role in 2016, <em>Jason Bourne</em>\u2019s numbers were comparable to the highly-successful <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em> with $416 million in worldwide earnings. And yet, it faced the worst reviews of the series. CinemaBlend\u2019s own Eric Eisenberg gave the film <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/1538609/jason-bourne\">2 out of 5 stars</a>, calling it \u201cforced and unnecessary.\u201d Frank Marshall has also been a producer on every <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie, including the fifth movie James Mangold is directing. Marshall <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546932/why-indiana-jones-5-was-right-to-bring-on-logans-director-according-to-the-producer\">called the recent shift \u201call the right pieces coming together\u201d</a> after Steven Spielberg exited from helming the film. Marshall also recently <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546777/wait-jurassic-world-3-wont-be-the-end-of-the-jurassic-park-franchise-after-all\">spoke to his involvement in the <em>Jurassic World</em> trilogy</a> too, calling the end of 2021\u2019s <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em> the \u201cstart of a new era.\u201d What do you think about another <em>Bourne</em> movie coming to theaters in the future?

    "title": "How Pop Culture Will Respond To The 2020 Pandemic, According To Jason Blum And Leigh Whannell",
    "content": "At this stage, nobody is quite clear on what effects the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately have on the film industry, with questions still looming about everything from how the production process will be altered, to how the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2495397/florida-theater-chain-files-for-bankruptcy-after-closings\">theatrical experience</a> will change. But it\u2019s not just about the business. Pop culture has a tendency to reflect the world in which its primary audience lives, and right now we can\u2019t be sure how that will manifest once \u201cnormal\u201d life resumes. Will there be a flood of movies about deadly contagions? Will there be an influx of stories with isolation as a key theme? Or will movies do everything in their power to distract us from reality? Given the prominent role that fear currently has in our society, the future of the horror genre in particular will be interesting to watch \u2013 which is why I brought the subject up when I recently had the opportunity to interview Blumhouse founder <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2492461/how-the-hunt-stars-and-filmmakers-feel-about-the-movies-deeply-ironic-delay\">Jason Blum</a> and writer/director <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2491155/why-its-wrong-to-think-the-invisible-mans-villain-is-all-in-the-head-of-elisabeth-moss-cecilia\">Leigh Whannell</a>. With <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/previews/2480552/the-invisible-man\"><em>The Invisible Man</em></a> out on Blu-ray today, I had the chance to catch up with them over video chat last week, and you can watch our discussion about the future of COVID-19 in pop culture by clicking play on the video below: In the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496041/chris-pratt-and-elizabeth-banks-reunite-for-lego-movie-themed-covid-19-psa\">COVID-19</a>, there will be two kinds of films that approach the subject matter: those that directly tell stories about life during the pandemic, and those that feature it exclusively in subtext. In the case of the former, Jason Blum predicts that we\u2019ll likely see a number of them, but he also doesn\u2019t exactly expect much from them. Per the producer, they\u2019ll capture certain aspects of what life in 2020 is like, but he believes that they won\u2019t be able to feature real insight into events because they are too close to it: There is certainly a logic to this thinking. A film made immediately in the aftermath of the pandemic about the pandemic will be able to include firm details about the experience, but it will be impossible for it to capture the lasting effect of the stay at home orders because the world will still be changing as its being made. As <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2491733/following-the-invisible-man-blumhouse-is-tackling-a-dracula-movie?pv=related_list\">Jason Blum</a> says, it may be a full decade before we fully understand how the ongoing events end up reshaping everyday life, and the movies made then that reflect on this time will really have something to say. The more subtle approach, however, is a different story \u2013 and Jason Blum seems to suggest that it could cut both ways as far as both intention and reception. Using romantic comedies as an example, he noted that the way that the stories \u201cfeel\u201d will be altered, even if the events of the last few months are never specifically mentioned. Said Blum, Picking up the baton, Leigh Whannell also considered the situation from the perspective of the audience, and added his belief that there may not be much of a demand for stories set during the 2020 pandemic. What we are living through currently is traumatic on a societal scale, and when it comes to watching movies in the aftermath the writer/director doesn\u2019t feel like people will be aching to watch big screen stories about that trauma. Said Whannell, Given that we are still in the middle of the pandemic, any firm answers about the future in this regard are obviously totally up in the air, but it\u2019s something we\u2019ll definitely be keeping an eye on as movie fans. On that note, entertainment is definitely a wonderful resource in these crazy times, and now audiences can watch <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2490784/the-invisible-man-review-we-finally-have-a-great-new-universal-classic-monsters-movie\">one of 2020\u2019s best films</a> at home.

However, if you ask any fan of <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/firefly\"><em>Firefly</em></a> the same question and Joss Whedon\u2019s cult sci-fi western might be their answer. Excluding a select few, including the aforementioned fans of <em>Firefly</em>, most people seem to have forgotten about the decade-long career that Christina Hendricks led prior to landing her six-time Emmy-nominated role on <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1359629/Watch-Final-Mad-Men-Scene-All-Its-Glory\">AMC\u2019s acclaimed period drama</a> exploring the inside world of 1960s-era advertising. As Joan Holloway Harris is often considered <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2470277/good-girls-renewed-for-season-3-on-nbc\">the <em>Good Girls</em> star\u2019s</a> breakout role, it is easily forgivable as it also bears an opportunity for a deeper dive into the earlier moments of her career. The following are seven notable TV appearances of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1528400/wonder-woman-could-have-been-played-by-an-unexpected-tv-star\">stunning, talented redhead</a> before she broke out on <em>Mad Men</em>. Let us start by taking a trip back to a time when <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Why-Doesn-t-MTV-Play-Music-Videos-Anymore-Funny-Video-Explains-49233.html\">music videos were still played on television</a>. In 2000, Christina Hendricks made her debut in a creation by super-producer Joss Whedon, in this case <em>Angel</em>, starring <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1638760/bones-david-boreanaz-already-has-a-new-tv-show-lined-up\">future <em>Bones</em> star David Boreanaz</a> as the vampiric title character. In a 2000 episode from the first season of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1575900/angel-vs-spike-who-buffy-was-better-with-according-to-joss-whedon\"><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> spin-off</a> titled \"The Prodigal,\" we get a glimpse of Angel's past as a reckless, drunken mortal in the 18th Century. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTCDbCRtQW0\">In one flashback</a>, we also catch a glimpse of Hendricks as an unnamed bar maid with an Irish accent who gives a very intrigued Darla a poetic explanation as to why his \"charm\" is not worth falling for. Christina Hendricks' character from the eighth season of <em>ER</em> probably could have used some similar advice. The actress appeared in four episodes of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2469415/why-ers-executive-producer-doesnt-want-to-see-the-medical-drama-rebooted\">hit NBC medical drama</a> as Joyce Westlake, a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbfN6M4DRW0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">young, friendly, recently moved-in neighbor</a> of Dr. Abby Lockhart, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2478672/the-affairs-maura-tierney-shares-thoughts-on-ruth-wilsons-mystery-exit\">played by series regular Maura Tierney</a>, who discovers that her new friend is a victim of violent domestic abuse at the hands of her husband, Brian (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2490946/gossip-girl-where-are-the-cast-members-now\">future <em>Gossip Girl</em> star Matthew Settle</a>). When Joyce refuses to report him, Abby goes to dangerous lengths to help her escape any further attacks. In her second collaboration with Joss Whedon, the producer decided to give Christina Hendricks a character with screen time that lasts longer than 30 seconds and a name... well, more than one name, in fact. While primarily referred to as \"Saffron,\" Hendricks' recurring role on the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2546703/what-the-firefly-cast-is-doing-now\">cult sci-fi western TV series <em>Firefly</em></a> assumes multiple identities (including known aliases \"Bridget\" and \"Yolanda Haymer\") to con unsuspecting men out of their own riches by seducing and feigning matrimony with them. However, Saffron managed to fool Serenity captain Malcolm \"Mal\" Reynolds, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2387641/nathan-fillion-will-apparently-reprise-fireflys-captain-mal-for-new-guest-spot\">played by Nathan Fillion</a>, after drunkenly participating in a real marriage ceremony with him and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfIprXM72LY\">taking advantage of the \"relationship\" to infiltrate the spacecraft</a> and cause trouble. Before Christina Hendricks played a bombshell in the 1960s, she played a bombshell in the 1940s. In \"Colors,\" from the fourth season of the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/814589/Trace-Cold-Case-May-Get-Axe\">CBS retrospective crime procedural</a> <em>Cold Case</em>, Lilly Rush (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Cold-Case-Kathryn-Morris-Married-Brad-Pitt-Moneyball-19516.html\">Kathryn Morris</a>) takes the case of Clyde Taylor (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Yaya-DaCosta-Whitney-Houston-Doppelg-auml-nger-Lifetime-Photo-65193.html\">Arlen Escarpeta</a>), a black baseball player beaten to death with his own bat in August of 1945. The investigation leads to the discovery of Clyde's forbidden romance with a white woman named Esther Davis (also given the nickname \"Legs\") played in modern day by <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/10-Brilliant-Canceled-Shows-Fox-Used-Air-Sunday-Nights-67645.html\">Elinor Donahue</a> and in flashbacks by Hendricks. Vegas sounds like just <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Mad-Men-Video-Sums-Up-Don-Draper-Less-Than-Two-Minutes-62415.html\">the place that Don Draper would have a field day</a> at, but it was a different <em>Mad Men</em> regular who got to pay Sin City a visit on the hit NBC drama named after the beloved city. In \"Chaos Theory,\" a Season 3 episode of <em>Las Vegas</em>, Christina Hendricks plays Connie, who finds herself to be a subject of interrogation at the Montecito Resort and Casino by Danny McCoy (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Interview-Josh-Duhamel-3983.html\">Josh Duhamel</a>) and Mike Cannon (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/Uncle-Buck-Trailer-Looks-Similar-Original-Also-Funny-71855.html\">James Lesure</a>), who believe she is linked to a gambler making the suspicious request to play a game of Blackjack at $1 million dollars per hand. Going back to the earlier days of her on-screen career, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEUWx4LA7jU\">this 1998 music video</a> for the song \u201cOne Hit Wonder\u201d by Everclear, which is directed by <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/471149/McG-Takes-Over-Submarine-Thriller-Hunter-Killer\">music video veteran and future blockbuster helmer McG</a>, Christina Hendricks plays Loopy. The young woman is a hopeful contestant on a <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2489743/the-unexpected-reason-why-the-price-is-right-is-so-hard-to-remake-in-other-countries\"><em>The Price is Right</em>-esque competition program</a> hosted by <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/ravens/2020/01/09/nfl-playoffs-ravens-wink-martindale-has-fan-game-show-host/2845969001/\">game show veteran Wink Martindale</a>, the object of which is ambiguous, to say the least. When Loopy is selected to move onto the next round of the game by correctly guessing the winning lyrics to the titular song, apparently, she eventually comes out on top and goes home with the grand prizes: a brand new, shining mobile home and the alternative rock trio themselves, dressed in equally shiny golden tuxedos.

Before you ask - no, Christina Hendricks' character Tanya is not a love interest for Stamos, but instead plays the unwitting temptress of Jake's married friend, Adrian, (<a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1533730/supergirl-season-2-just-added-a-justice-league-comic-character\">Ian Gomez</a>), who has just been hired as his new dental assistant.

    "title": "8 Must-Watch Tom Hardy Movies If You're A Fan Of The Venom Star",
    "content": "As an accomplished, versatile actor who is often quick to challenge himself and put himself into different projects, both big and small, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/tom-hardy\">Tom Hardy</a> is one of our most riveting and impressive actors. While some viewers might know him best for <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/tag/venom\"><em>Venom</em></a>, that Sony blockbuster only gives us a brief look at what he can do. Certainly, Hardy has proven the depths of his versatility in a number of outstanding performances, even in some films where his work is better than the movie itself \u2014 though that is a matter of opinion. If you love Tom Hardy, you should make a point to check out these movies. In this thunderous title role, Tom Hardy rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 leaves our focus in <em>Bronson</em>. As one of the most violent, infamous prisoners in Britain history, <em>Bronson</em> certainly isn't an endearing protagonist on the page. But through Hardy's uproarious turn, it's invigorating. He's our central figure in every respect, appearing in nearly every frame, while also narrating his story and adding his own commentary throughout his unique look at his locked-up life. It's a colorful, sensational, boisterous role \u2014 one where our lead really needs to demand our full attention. Thankfully, Hardy is more-than-capable of delivering the goods in Nicolas Winding Refn's highly entertaining, (possibly) strongest film. His captivating take on Charles Bronson is stunning and immersive, making you forget about the performance and only letting you see the larger-than-life true-life character presented. It's an incredible, astonishing performance \u2014 arguably Hardy's best yet. Stream it on <a href=\"https://tubitv.com/movies/437419/bronson?utm_source=google-feed&amp;tracking=google-feed\">Tubi</a>. <em>Locke</em> is the sort of premise that shouldn't work as a feature-length film. It follows our title character, Ivan Locke (Tom Hardy), the only on-screen character, driving to London to be with a one-night-stand who is prematurely in labor with his child, leaving behind his duties on an important night job and his awaiting wife and sons, who expect him home for a big game. We watch our central character take call after call, breaking apart the life he's build, piece-by-piece, to do what he believes is right after an egregious wrong. It takes place entirely in the confines of a car, watching a man drive and answer life-altering calls. It's not flashy, nor exceptionally cinematic. But through Hardy's mesmerizing performance, we're riveted. Only someone this commanding could pull this off, but it works wonderfully thanks to his exhilarating performance. From the beginning, you're hooked. Stream it on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/search?q=locke&amp;jbv=70295189&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0\">Netflix</a>. Certainly compared to other performances on this list, <em>Lawless</em> isn't Tom Hardy's flashiest or most showy work. He plays a coolly contemplative presence throughout the 2012 western, complete with deadpan delivery and an emotionally-reserved exterior. His grumbling, mumbling performance might not work for everyone, but in a film sparked by violence and anarchy, notably with Shia LaBeouf's <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/True-Story-Behind-Shia-LaBeouf-Tom-Hardy-Set-Fight-113267.html\">controversial on-set behavior</a>, Hardy's rugged-yet-nuanced role is a key part of the film's success. Under the character's rough exterior is an intelligent, introspective, hard-fought man, and Hardy's layered performance captures that dichotomy well. Not many actors can make a refrained, inward character come to life on the screen, but it's clear that Hardy is adept at making both splashy and subtle characters work in his favor. <em>Lawless</em> is a pretty good example of the latter case. It's a fine showcase for his captivating presence, even when scaled back. Stream it on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/search?q=lawless&amp;jbv=70213471&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0\">Netflix.</a> Two Tom Hardys for the price of one? What more do you need to know? Indeed, Hardy takes on dual roles in <em>Legend</em>, a biopic about the Kray twins, a pair of English criminals who terrorized London throughout the '50s and '60s. While the movie never matches Hardy's rich dedication otherwise, the actor gives two of his finest performances here, providing not one, but two nuanced and compelling performances \u2014 which is particularly impressive whenever he must act opposite himself. That's a task that's certainly not easy, even for the best actors, but Hardy pulls it off handily, which makes the movie itself well worth seeking out for his fans. It's a shame the rest of <em>Legend</em> is lukewarm and forgettable \u2014ironically enough\u2014 never matching the wit and passion of its actor's committed portrayals, but Hardy fans would certainly be remiss if they skipped it. Stream it on <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/search?q=tom%20hardy&amp;jbv=80057599&amp;jbp=0&amp;jbr=0\">Netflix</a>. Admittedly, <em>Capone</em> isn't exactly what you expect from a gangster biopic. This isn't a cradle-to-the-grave look at the notorious criminal's life. Instead, this is a hand-in-the-grave examination of an intimidating mobster at his weakest, most fragile and vulnerable point. Examining the last year of his life before Al Capone passed away at a mere 48 years old, writer/director Josh Trank makes an unsettling, deeply unconventional look at the horrors that come from dying and deteriorating at an early age, knowing that your legacy is behind you and any sort of redemption and salvation you wish to find won't come into reach. Naturally, that's a hard sell; it's understandable why many found this strange, morbid film <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496018/tom-hardys-capone-reviews-are-in-heres-what-critics-are-saying\">off-putting</a>. But even if <em>Capone</em> isn't your bag, you can't take your eyes off Tom Hardy's portrayal. His <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2496002/capone-review-a-tour-de-force-tom-hardy-performance-carries-this-irregular-gangster-pic\">bizarre, unhinged lead performance</a> is magnetizing and absolutely arresting, not to mention even darkly funny at times too. Execution is key. On the paper, 2011's <em>Warrior</em> could've been a tepid, familiar sports/family drama with a cookie-cutter story and expected beats. But Gavin O'Conner's tender, visceral, effectively grounded film is a bonafide winner, notably in how it brings out the goods with its lead actors, including Joel Edgerton, Nick Nolte, and Tom Hardy. As the beefed-up ex-marine who clashes with his brother in a mixed martial arts tournament, Hardy is gruff and intimidating, but we often see his moody, reflective side. While it's easy to focus on his muscle-bound intensity, what truly makes this performance sing is the soft sensitivity Hardy showcases in the quieter, more intimate moments. Hardy's performance, much like the fine work of his co-stars, is a key reason why <em>Warrior</em> transcends cliches and potential melodramatic tendencies to become an affecting, engrossing tale of masculinity, emotional distance, dysfunctional homes, and self-discovery. Stream it on <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/movie/warrior-59b05290-3dc3-4a68-a37e-dae176ea4e12\">Hulu</a>. Though <em>The Revenant</em> is <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2489261/the-10-best-leonardo-dicaprio-movies-ranked\">typically considered Leonardo DiCaprio's movie</a>, notably since it's the one that got him his Best Actor Oscar, Tom Hardy's performance as John Fitzgerald shouldn't be overlooked. Though it won't be the role that he's most remembered for, it was the role that finally earned him his first (and only) Oscar nomination, serving as the antagonistic figure whom DiCaprio's left-for-dead Hugh Glass <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Revenant-Ending-How-It-Differs-From-History-104997.html\">seeks to hunt and kill.</a> As we've noted, Hardy brings a brooding physicality and an unwavering intensity to his most noteworthy roles, showcasing a menacing, intimidating presence that's befitting of the grueling, unrelenting terrain shown throughout <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/new/How-Tom-Hardy-Broke-Tension-Set-Revenant-91447.html\">this grizzly awards contender.</a> While he doesn't get as much screen-time as his Oscar-winning co-star, Hardy certainly proves to be a formidable opponent, bringing a malign and deprived humanity to what might've been a stock, leaden villainous character in a lesser actor's hands. Modern action movies don't get much better \u2014 or <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1671170/the-reason-for-tom-hardy-and-charlize-therons-mad-max-beef-according-to-zoe-kravitz\">any madder, really</a> \u2014 than <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>. Though it's the fourth film in writer/director George Miller's dystopian action movie series, <em>Fury Road</em> is bristling with life, energy, and inspiration, producing arguably the best, <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496153/sounds-like-tom-hardy-regrets-mad-max-fury-road-on-set-drama\">most intense</a>, most invigorated installment in the franchise. Taking over the reigns from Mel Gibson, who played the title role in the original three films, Hardy's Max is almost a silent movie character, complete with a face mask covering up his mouth throughout a good chunk of the first act. Relying a great deal on Hardy's wide-eyed expressions and raging fierceness, Hardy's assumes the popular role with vigor and humor, resulting in an arguably more maniacal, sometimes even goofier portrayal. But Hardy does bring bit of somberness and emotional gravity to the famous role in key moments too, making it his own. In addition to these roles, you should also make a point to check out Tom Hardy in <em>The Drop, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Inception,</em> and <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> if you haven't seen those movies already.

It\u2019s no longer \u201cwill we see Zack Snyder\u2019s <em>Justice League</em>?\u201d It\u2019s now, \u201cWhat will be in it <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546877/watch-justice-leagues-cyborg-actor-get-emotional-about-the-snyder-cut-happening?pv=search\">once it screens</a> in 2021?\u201d This morning, on the day that the streaming service launched (you can <a href=\"https://www.hbomax.com/?utm_source=cinema_blend&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=pre-launch\">sign up for it right here</a>), Zack Snyder tipped his hand to a look at Darkseid, the villain who will be teased in the upcoming superhero blockbuster. This is not to say that Darkseid will be the King Daddy villain in <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2496562/release-the-snyder-cut-zack-snyders-justice-league-going-to-hbo-max?pv=search\">Zack Snyder\u2019s <em>Justice League</em></a>. That is still expected to be Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), who was the primary antagonist in the theatrical cut of <em>Justice League</em>, and still is expected to be the threat that comes to Earth to retrieve the Motherboxes on Darkseid\u2019s behalf. Those of us who have followed every step of the Release the Snyder Cut movement might even know the scene where this glimpse of Darkseid takes place in Zack Snyder\u2019s <em>Justice League</em>. <strong>Stop reading now if you want to avoid possible spoilers for the movie.</strong> From what we understand, the movie once ended with the members of the League defeating Steppenwolf. Aquaman (Jason Momoa) picks up the villain and throws him. Superman (Henry Cavill) might punch him somewhere in the process, but the sequence ends with Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) beheading Steppenwolf and sending his head through a Boom Tube. On the other side of that Boom Tube? Darkseid, looking down at the League, promising a future battle. Now, the thing about the version of Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League that will be coming to HBO Max is that things can change. Snyder has been given the greenlight to go back into his version and tinker, though there have been conflicting reports about what that really means. <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2494363/would-justice-leagues-martian-manhunter-actor-do-reshoots-for-the-snyder-cut?pv=search\">He says he will do reshoots</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546921/the-snyder-cut-may-be-more-expensive-than-we-thought?pv=search\">reports about the budget</a> being handed to him are all over the map. So for now, we wait to see what develops. But this is a tremendous mic drop of an image for a director who has been <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2487484/zack-snyder-admits-hes-tired-of-people-who-say-snyder-cut-doesnt-exist?pv=search\">told repeatedly</a>, for the better part of three years, that his <a href=\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2546756/suicide-squad-and-6-other-movies-that-deserve-the-snyder-cut-treatment?pv=search\"><em>Justice League</em></a> movie would never see the light of day. On the day that HBO Max, the streaming service that showed faith in him, launched for new consumers, Snyder showed off an image of something exciting that he hopes to bring to the platform in 2021.
